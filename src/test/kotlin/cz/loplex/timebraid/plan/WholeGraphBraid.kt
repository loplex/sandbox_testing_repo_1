/**
 * The braid a pass over the **whole graph** would produce: [topoOrder] over every commit, filtered
 * down to the mainline first-parent chains.
 *
 * This is the far end of [BraidInterleave]'s scope: opting in every commit puts the whole graph in
 * scope, and the braid should then match this exactly. Written independently, so the tests can
 * assert that end of the spectrum rather than reason about it — and so the difference from the
 * default end stays visible as an assertion: a whole-graph pass holds a merge back until every one
 * of its parents has been emitted, including a merged-in side branch's tip, and that moves where
 * the merge lands relative to another repository's commits.
