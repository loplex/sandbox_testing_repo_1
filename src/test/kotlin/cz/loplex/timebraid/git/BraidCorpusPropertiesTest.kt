/**
 * The properties [BraidInterleave] promises, checked against real repositories rather than the
 * synthetic graphs the unit tests use — thousands of commits with timestamps that genuinely run
 * backwards here and there, which is what these properties exist to survive:
 *
 * 1. **The write order is topological over the braided history.** Every parent, original or braid,
 *    comes before its child, so no commit is ever written referring to an object that does not exist.
 * 2. **No braid edge points into the future.** Where a braid commit's predecessor comes from another
 *    repository, that predecessor is never timestamped later than the commit itself.
 *
 * It also reports, without asserting on it, how much the braid would differ if it were interleaved
 * over the whole graph instead of over the mainline chains alone ([WholeGraphBraid]) — the difference
 * being merges whose merged-in branch is timestamped after the merge itself. On the three-repository,
 * 14 387-commit history this was developed against, the two came out identical: 0 of 6929 braid
 * positions moved. That number is a measurement of one corpus, not a guarantee, which is exactly why
 * it is printed rather than asserted.
 *
 * Opt-in, because a corpus of large real repositories does not belong in this tree. Point
 * `-Dtimebraid.corpus` at a directory of bare clones:
 *
 * ```
 * mvn -q test -Dtest=BraidCorpusPropertiesTest -Dtimebraid.corpus=/path/to/bare-clones
 * ```
