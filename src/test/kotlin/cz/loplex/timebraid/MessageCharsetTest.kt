/**
 * Every string literal the program can print is spelled in ASCII.
 *
 * A JVM on Windows picks the charset for `System.out` from where the stream goes: an OEM code page
 * (cp437, cp852) for a console, the ANSI one (cp1252) for a pipe. The OEM pages have no em dash and
 * no ellipsis, and what the encoder does with a character its charset lacks is substitute a `?` —
 * so a message written with one loses it, and loses it only for the user running the tool by hand.
 * Redirected output keeps it, which is why a CI log is no evidence either way.
 *
 * The check reads the compiled classes rather than the sources: a string literal is one the
 * compiler put in the constant pool, so comments and KDoc — read in an editor, where the dash is
 * worth having — are out of scope without a rule having to describe them. A `Char` literal is not
 * a string, though: it compiles to a number, which nothing in a class file tells apart from any
 * other, so a `'─'` handed to `padEnd` or `repeat` goes unseen here, as does a character made at
 * run time.
 *
 * One character is exempt, and only because it is never printed. Clikt's help formatter hands a
 * help string to mordant as plain text, collapsing a lone `\n` into a space, and takes U+0085 (NEL)
 * as a hard line break — `Text.wrap` breaks on it and emits a newline in its place, so the
 * character itself reaches no encoder and no console. It is how a help entry puts its default on a
 * line of its own without spending a blank one. Anything else outside ASCII is still reported,
 * including a NEL's neighbour U+2028, which mordant also breaks on but which nothing here needs.
