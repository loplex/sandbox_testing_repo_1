/**
 * Decides *the braid*: which commits form the output's single interleaved mainline, and in what order.
 *
 * What the braid guarantees is written for the reader in doc/how-it-works.md, a property to a
 * place: a chain's own order in doc/how-it-works.md#the-parent-rule, the promise that no braid edge
 * reaches anything younger than the commit it leaves in
 * doc/how-it-works.md#a-merge-can-carry-a-repositorys-future-and-pass-it-on, and that by default
 * nothing off a mainline moves where two mainlines meet in
 * doc/how-it-works.md#trading-the-guarantee-away-on-purpose, which is also where `--interleave-ref`
 * gives up the third, and the second with it. What follows is why this implementation has those
 * properties, rather than what they are: stating a rule in two places is how the two come to
 * disagree.
 *
 * The braid is the union of the input repositories' mainline first-parent chains. Their order is
 * decided by Kahn's algorithm with a priority queue — keep the commits whose parents have all been
 * emitted, always take the one with the earliest timestamp — run not over the whole graph but over a
 * **scope**: the mainline chains, plus the ancestors of whatever refs the caller opted in through
 * the `interleaveTips` parameter of [compute]. [reparent] then turns consecutive braid members
 * into parent edges, which is what makes `git log --first-parent` walk the braid.
 *
 * **With no opted-in refs — the default — the scope is the mainline chains alone**, and since those are
 * disjoint paths the pass reduces exactly to a k-way merge of one queue per repository: the ready set
 * holds each chain's current front, and the earliest of them wins. The three properties the document
 * states follow from that shape, rather than from a comparator that would have to be trusted to stay
 * consistent:
 *
 * 1. Kahn emits a parent before its child, so two commits of one chain keep their order whatever their
 *    timestamps say — which a rebase or a skewed clock makes routine.
 * 2. When a commit's predecessor comes from another chain, that commit was already in the ready set
 *    when the predecessor was taken, so the predecessor won a direct comparison against it. The
 *    artificial time edge this class hands to [reparent] can consequently never point into the future.
 * 3. Nothing off a mainline chain is in scope, so nothing off one can move where two repositories'
 *    mainlines meet. It is a property of the default scope and not of the selection, which is what
 *    makes it something `--interleave-ref` can give up rather than something that could break.
 *    Property 2 goes with it: a merge waiting on a side branch in scope is not in the ready set
 *    when its predecessor is taken, which is how it comes to follow a younger commit of another
 *    repository.
 *
 * Widening the scope stays safe whatever is named: cross-repository pairs have no ancestry relation at
 * all (the inputs are independent histories), same-repository braid members are ordered by property 1,
 * and neither depends on the scope — so a braid built here can never close a cycle when reparented.
 * Every original edge is preserved regardless; ancestry is a property of the *write* order
 * ([topoOrder], run after reparenting), not of the braid.
 *
 * Note the invariant properties 1 and 2 rest on: **one chain per repository.** A repository contributes
 * exactly one because the mainline resolves to one branch tip per input. Two divergent-and-reconverging
 * chains of a single repository would break the argument and are out of scope.
