/**
 * A graph's edges in the flat form the walks want: both directions as a pair of arrays each,
 * addressed by the graph's own numbering.
 *
 * Filled in a **single pass** over the nodes, so [Graph.parentsOf] is asked about each node exactly
 * once. That matters beyond the pointer chasing: a graph that filters its edges — the braid's scope
 * does — allocates a list per node to answer, and a second pass would pay for it twice. The parents
 * land in a flat array as they arrive and the children are counted on the way past, so reversing
 * them afterwards never leaves the ints.
 *
 * The alternative, one `IntArray` of parent indices per node, is one object per node of short-lived
 * garbage: 26 MB per build over a 600k-commit history, three builds to a plan.
