/**
 * Kahn's algorithm over [graph], [precedence] deciding between the nodes that are ready at any
 * moment. Both passes of this package are this walk; they differ in which graph they hand it and
 * what they keep of the result, not in what it does.
 *
 * Keep the set of nodes whose parents have all been emitted, and always take the one
 * [precedence] puts first. Membership of that ready set means no ancestry relation connects those nodes —
 * if `x` were an ancestor of `y`, `y` could not have entered the set before `x` was emitted — so
 * parents-before-children holds by construction rather than by a comparator that has to be trusted
 * to be consistent.
 *
 * Ordering part of a graph is done by handing over that part: a [Graph] reports the nodes it has and
 * the edges between them, so a part reports the parents that are in it and the walk waits for
 * nothing outside it.
 *
 * The walk runs on [IndexedGraph.indexOf] — counting edges down wants flat arrays rather than a graph
 * of objects, and the numbering a caller already has spares it a map from node to slot. A caller
 * passes a graph and gets its nodes back.
 *
 * [precedence] chooses among the nodes that are ready, and only among those, so it decides which
 * valid order comes out and never whether the order is valid — an inconsistent comparator cannot
 * produce a child before its parent here. Ties break on [IndexedGraph.indexOf] — a field the node
 * carries where the graph has one, and the fallback numbering where it does not — which is what makes
 * the result a deterministic function of the input: the same graph gives byte-identical output in
 * this run and in any other, and two distinct nodes can never compare equal and collapse.
