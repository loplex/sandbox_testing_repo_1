 *
 * Two repositories may contain the same commit sha without interfering — the inputs are independent
 * histories — so [id] alone does not identify a commit. The pair with [source] does, and so does this
 * object.
 *
 * A commit comes into being the moment anything names it, which is usually as somebody's parent: a
 * repository log is walked newest first, so a commit is mentioned before it is reached. Its own data
 * arrives when [CommitGraphBuilder.addCommit] is given it, and until then reading [time] or [parents]
 * is an error rather than a blank. No commit of a built graph is in that state:
 * [CommitGraphBuilder.build] is exactly what refuses a history with a gap left in it.
