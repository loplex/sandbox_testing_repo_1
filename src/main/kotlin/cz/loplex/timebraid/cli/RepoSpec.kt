 * lands, and what tells two inputs apart. The name labels the repository — the tag and branch
 * prefixes and the provenance label by default, and what `--root-repo` and an `<input>::` scope
 * match — and two inputs may share one.
 *
 * The subdirectory comes first because placing an input is what most arguments do, and the name
 * follows from it unless it is given: `::apps/webui` places and names in one token. The `=` is for
 * the case the two have to differ, which is a decision rather than an afterthought.
 *
 * The grammar is anchored on the **last** `::` in the argument, and there is nothing else to it.
 * Everything before that is the location, taken verbatim; everything after it is the subdirectory
 * and the name. Nothing is guessed and nothing is guarded: an argument that cannot be read this way
 * is refused, never quietly reread.
 *
 * Two consequences are the whole reason for this shape:
 *
 * - The location needs no escaping and can hold anything, `=` and `::` included, because appending
 *   `::` always ends it exactly where it ends. (If the location ends in *k* colons, the argument
 *   ends in *k+2*, so the last `::` starts at the location's length — for every location there is.)
 * - The suffix holds no `:` at all, because one is refused rather than escaped. It cannot then hold
 *   a `::` of its own, so the last one in the argument is always the separator.
 *
 * Refusing the colon costs less than escaping it would, and not only in a parser nobody reads: a
 * `:` is illegal in a git ref name, and under the default prefixes the name becomes a tag prefix.
 *
 * A name may hold a `/`, each of its segments one a directory could be called: it is a label, and
 * `libs/core` is a fine one. Whether it can stand in a ref name as well is asked later, where the
 * templates that put it in one are known; git's rules for a ref name are asked only there.
