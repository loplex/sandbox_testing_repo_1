/**
 * The output repository, opened for writing.
 *
 * The inputs' own objects arrive by [fetchFrom]; everything the braid invents on top of them —
 * the rewritten commits, the new trees, the tag objects — is written through a single
 * [ObjectInserter], and where the storage backend allows it that inserter is a *pack* inserter,
 * because one pack file is the difference between a repository that opens instantly and a directory
 * holding tens of thousands of loose files.
 *
 * Objects only become visible to readers — including this repository's own ref updates — after
 * [flushObjects]. Refs are therefore written in a second pass, once every commit exists.
 *
 * @param log receives the `git` command each *bounded* operation here is the in-process equivalent
 *   of — the transfer, each ref written or dropped, and `HEAD` — wired to `--verbose`. What
 *   it deliberately leaves out is the per-object writing: [writeCommit] and the trees under it run
 *   once per commit rather than once per run, and no line they could print would be a command
 *   anyone could run. A `git commit-tree` naming them would quote ids that live in an
 *   [ObjectInserter] no reader can see until [flushObjects], and re-running it reproduces the id
 *   only if author, committer, both dates and the message match to the byte. The plan behind those
 *   writes is available as text, one line per commit, through `--plan-out`.

     * this run never meant to include; a ref pointing at an object that is not there is a broken
     * repository, and so is a repository holding history nobody asked for. The one addition is a
