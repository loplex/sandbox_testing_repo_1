/**
 * Rebuilds the `.gitmodules` of the inputs into the one the output needs.
 *
 * `.gitmodules` is the only file in a repository whose *location* is part of its meaning: git reads
 * it from the repository root and nowhere else. Every other blob can therefore be carried into the
 * output by reference, inside its input's subdirectory, but this one cannot — moved to
 * `<subdir>/.gitmodules` it becomes text nothing reads, and the `path` it records no longer says
 * where the gitlink it describes actually sits. So the output's copy is synthesized instead: one
 * root-level file per commit, merging the `.gitmodules` of every input that has content at that
 * point in the braid, with each `path` rewritten to where that input's content landed.
 *
 * The gitlink entries themselves need no help — they ride along in their input's tree like any other
 * entry, and the commit they name is fetched from the submodule's own url, not from this repository.
 * The one exception is a gitlink an input's own content replaces; see [merge].
 *
 * A section's *name* is prefixed as well, not just its path. The name is what git uses to store a
 * populated submodule under `.git/modules/`, so two inputs whose submodules happen to share a name
 * would otherwise be handed the same directory. Where no destination contains another, which the
 * planner enforces, `<subdir>/<name>` is unique by construction: `libs/a` with a section `b/x`
 * cannot collide with `libs/a/b` and its section `x`, because the pair never arrives. `--splice`
 * lets it arrive, and so does the repository at the output root, which every destination is inside
 * of, and a blank name, which [prefixed] leaves as it is, meets another blank one wherever it
 * stands; in each the uniqueness is not a property of the destinations but a refusal in [merge],
 * which names the submodule and the commit carrying it.
