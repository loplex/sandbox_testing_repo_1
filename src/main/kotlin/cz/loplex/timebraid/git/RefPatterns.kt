/**
 * The patterns one option was given, each with the input it speaks for, written

 *
 * **What follows the scope is git's refspec**, `<pattern>[:<destination>]`, so a value valid as a
 * git refspec means the same here: `refs/heads/main:refs/tags/main` reads the branch and writes it
 * as a tag. The differences are few and each on purpose: a destination may be a namespace
 * (`refs/tags/`) handed to that namespace's prefix, and may hold `{repo}` and `{subdir}`; a pattern
 * with stars may go without a destination, which `git fetch` allows only in a negative refspec, or
 * name one ref as its destination; and there is no `+`, no empty pattern or destination, and no
 * short name, every pattern matching full ref names.
 *
 * **The scope is ended by `::`**, the separator the `<repo>` grammar puts between a location and
 * its suffix: `backend::refs/heads/main` speaks for one input, and `refs/heads/main` for every one.
 * A scope cannot be empty — `::refs/…` is refused, the unscoped form already saying it. The
 * separator is decidable rather than a convention: a refspec holds at most one `:`, so never a
 * `::`.
 *
 * **The empty case stays per input, and keeps the meaning it had.** No pattern for an input is
 * that option's empty case for that input — every branch and tag for the selection, none for the
 * interleave and the labels. So `--ref backend::refs/heads/main` narrows backend and leaves the
 * other inputs carrying everything, which is the generalisation of *naming any ref leaves out
 * every ref not named* from the run to the input. An unscoped pattern narrows every input
 * exactly as before.
 *
 * **A `^` in front of the pattern subtracts instead of selecting**, the way git has written a
 * negative refspec since 2.29, and in the same place, before the refspec. It is decidable rather
 * than a convention, git refusing a `^` anywhere in a ref name. The mark goes after the scope
 * rather than in front of the whole value: `^backend::refs/heads/wip` would read as *not
 * backend*, which is a meaning this never has.
 *
 * @param inputs the inputs' names, in the order the run reads them, which is how a pattern's
 *   scope is looked up: [of] is asked by position.
 * @param emptyMeans what no pattern for an input says about that input — every branch and tag,
 *   or none. It is also what a run holding nothing but subtractions resolves against, which is
 *   why it is known here and not only in the reader's selection: where the empty case is no ref
 *   at all there is nothing to take back out, and such a run is refused rather than quietly
 *   matching nothing.

/**
 * Refuses a pattern that could never reach a ref, and one whose matches would have no name.
 *
 * A well-formed selection matching nothing is indistinguishable, from the command line, from an
 * input that simply does not have what was asked for — so a pattern under `refs/notes/` was as
 * quiet as `--ref 'refs/tags/v9.*'` against a repository with no v9. One of those is a fact
 * about the input and one is a fact about this program, and only the second can be said here.
 *
 * Outside `refs/heads/` and `refs/tags/` the question is not whether a ref *can* be read — a
 * Gerrit change and a forge's pull ref name commits like any other — but what it would be
 * called afterwards. Nothing qualifies a namespace the program has never heard of, so a pattern
 * that reads one has to say where its matches land, and the destination field is that answer.
 *
 * @param writes whether this option decides what is read and written, as opposed to what may
 *   weigh on the braid. Only the first kind needs a destination: the interleave matches refs
 *   some other pattern already brought in, so a foreign namespace there is already named.
