/**
 * Builds the trees of a braided commit: one entry per input repository that already has content at
 * this point in the braid, at its own destination — pointing straight at that repository's own
 * original tree where the destination is one segment, and at a tree this class built where it is
 * nested.
 *
 * This is the tree rule of doc/how-it-works.md made concrete. Nothing is recursed into and no blob is
 * rewritten — the entry at an input's destination *is* the original repository's root tree object,
 * which is why the output shares its content objects with the inputs and why writing costs a handful
 * of small trees per commit rather than a copy of the whole worktree.
 *
 * A destination may be nested (`libs/backend`), which is where the "handful" comes from: the
 * segments above the last one are trees this class builds, and two inputs under one prefix share the
 * tree for it.
 *
 * One case breaks the "nothing is recursed into" rule, and it is the only one: an input placed
 * *inside* another. That is the repository at the output root, which every other destination is
 * inside of, and it is equally any input whose destination is a prefix of another's. There the two
 * are **spliced** — the containing repository's tree at that path is read into entries
 * ([Placement.entriesOf]) and the input placed inside it goes in beside them. The descent follows
 * only the prefixes some destination names, and only down the containing repository's own trees.
 *
 * Whether one destination may contain another at all is not decided here. The planner decides that,
 * and refuses the pair unless the run asked for the splice; what is refused here is what only the
 * trees can show, and only for the commit they show it at: an input landing where the repository
 * around it already has an entry of that name, or reaching through one that is not a directory.
 *
 * [dissolveSubmodules] carves one case out of the first of those. Where the entry in the way is a
 * **gitlink**, the repository around it was already saying that this exact path holds another
 * repository, and an input placed there is that repository's history arriving for real — so the
 * gitlink gives way to the input's tree instead of colliding with it. The submodule's own section is
 * dropped from the output's `.gitmodules` to match; see [SubmoduleWiring.merge]. It stays opt-in
 * because the substitution is not faithful: a gitlink names one commit of the submodule, and what
 * lands in its place is whatever that input had reached at this point of the braid.
