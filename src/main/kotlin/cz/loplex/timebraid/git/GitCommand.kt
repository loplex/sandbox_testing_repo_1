/**
 * The entire subprocess surface of the program: the few git operations that are *not* object
 * plumbing — cloning a remote, refreshing a clone, adding a remote, filling in a working tree.
 *
 * These shell out to the user's own `git` on purpose. It already knows their ssh keys, credential
 * helpers and `url.*.insteadOf` rewrites; JGit's own transport would have to be handed each of them.
 * Object reading and writing stays in-process (JGit), which is where control and performance matter
 * and where a merge of three repositories spends all of its time.
 *
 * Inheriting that environment is the point, so it is passed through almost whole — see
 * [dropRedirectingVariables] for the one class of variable that is not.
 *
 * Each of the three that have something to report asks git for `--progress`, because git prints
 * none when its output is not a terminal — and this one's never is, being read here rather than
 * shown. Adding a remote is the fourth and reports nothing; filling in a working tree moves no
 * objects but counts files, so it draws. Reading it is not the same as dropping it: what arrives is
 * handed to the caller's `onProgress` as it arrives, while the lines go on being collected for the
 * log and for the tail a failure is reported with.
 *
 * @param log receives the command line and every line it prints — wired to `--verbose`. The line is
 *   rendered to be run: a command with a working directory is written with the `-C` that would take
 *   it there, so it says which repository it acted on rather than leaving that to the reader.
