     * that is what a fetch moves. All that was missing is a ref of the output's own that outlives
     * [TargetRepository.dropFetchRefs], and that is what this adds.

     * else: on a three-repository history of 14 387 commits, a corpus outside this
     * tree, 929 of them were reachable in their input from a tag alone, and

     * once git's grace period for unreachable objects, two weeks by default, has passed. They go
     * under `tags/` so that the branch `v1.0` and the tag `v1.0` of one
     * input do not land on the same name. That keeps the usual pair apart, and not every pair git
     * accepts: a branch literally named `tags/v1.0` still meets the tag `v1.0` here, and that is
     * refused, since either write winning would leave the other ref's originals with no mirror —
     * the mainline's included, which is mirrored whether the selection took it or not.
     *
     * A ref here points at the commit a tag peels to rather than at the input's own tag object.
     * What an annotated tag holds beyond its target — its tagger, its message — is recreated in
     * full by `BraidWriter` where the tag is written under `refs/tags/`, unless
     * `--lightweight-tags` asks for none. A tag a destination writes as a branch loses it as well,
     * and this mirror, pointing at the commit, keeps none of it.
     *
     * The mirror covers every ref the run carried over, the selection and the labels alike, so `-b`
     * narrows it as it narrows the output — bar the mainline, which the paragraph below exempts. A
     * label was not read and so was not fetched, but it is attached only where its target is already
     * in the graph — the object came in behind some selected ref's ancestry — so no mirrored ref
     * points at nothing.
     *
     * Each input's mainline is mirrored whether or not the selection named it. It is read either
     * way, so its originals are in the output either way, and a narrowed run would otherwise leave
     * exactly the chain the tags paragraph above is about: fetched, rewritten under the output's
     * own branch, and named by nothing at all.
     *
     * A name the braid already writes is refused rather than written over, the mainline's mirror
     * as much as any other. A destination spelled out under `refs/remotes/<name>/` can meet a
     * mirror there, and either write winning loses something: the mirror drops the rewritten commit
     * the destination asked for, the destination leaves the original unnamed. So, as for two inputs
     * meeting in [claim], the run is refused, and the refusal names both. So is a destination
     * there that meets no mirror: the remote's refspec covers the whole of `refs/remotes/<name>/`,
     * and a pruning fetch deletes whatever in it names no branch of the input.
