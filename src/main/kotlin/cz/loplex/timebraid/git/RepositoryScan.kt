/**
 * Reads an output layout off a directory tree instead of having it written out argument by
 * argument: every repository under one base directory becomes an input, placed in the output where
 * it sits on disk.
 *
 * The base directory is the output root, so a repository at `<base>/libs/backend` lands at
 * `libs/backend` and the base itself, when it is a repository, lands at the root — which is
 * `--root-repo` by another route, and needs no separate concept.
 *
 * Two rules decide what is looked at:
 *
 * - **A repository is not descended into.** Whatever is nested inside one is its own business —
 *   submodules, vendored checkouts, linked worktrees — and pulling those in as inputs of their own
 *   is a decision, not a default. The base directory is the exception: it is always descended into,
 *   because a scan of a repository that stopped at the repository would find nothing else.
 * - **Directories whose name begins with `.` are skipped**, and so are symlinks, which cannot be
 *   followed without the walk having to guard against a cycle. Either can still be given as an
 *   ordinary `<repo>` argument, which is what makes the pair complementary.
 *
 * And the run's own output is never a finding, wherever it sits and however `-o` spells it (a
 * symlink to it included): `-o merged.git` beside the inputs is the natural place for it, and a
 * second run would otherwise braid the first one's output as an input, or, forced to write into it,
 * the output into itself.
