\`${TAG}\` is published, but could not be carried back on its own: \`${DEFAULT_BRANCH}\` did not merge into
this branch cleanly, or merged into a tree the release rules refused, or refused the push that would have
landed it - having moved under it, or taking no push from the credential the run pushed with. The run that
tried says which of the three it met; why a push was refused, it cannot tell.

**Merge this with a merge commit.** Neither *Squash and merge* nor *Rebase and merge* may be used here:
\`${TAG}\` points at the release commit in this branch, and both of them replace that commit with a copy,
which leaves the tag off the history of \`${DEFAULT_BRANCH}\`. *Rebase and merge* does so even where a
fast-forward would do, because it always rewrites committer and date. The \`ancestry\` check goes red for
every commit afterwards if that happens.

Until this is merged, \`${DEFAULT_BRANCH}\` does not reach \`${TAG}\`: \`ancestry\` and \`changelog\` fail there
and on every other pull request into it - \`version\` too, where the source declares a version, which
\`${DEFAULT_BRANCH}\` still declares as the one just released - and no next release can be prepared.
