"""What merge-back does to a repository, tested against one built for the purpose.

A bare repository stands in for the remote, so a push is a real push and a refused fast-forward a real refusal.
That refusal is the path most worth testing, because it is the one that catches the race.
`gh` is a stub on PATH: what it would send to GitHub is recorded and asserted, and nothing is sent anywhere.

Run with `python3 -m unittest discover -s release-flow` from the repository root.
