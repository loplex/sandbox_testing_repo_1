# lib

[`main.py`](main.py) is the command line behind these actions:

- [`check-release`](../check-release/README.md) runs its checks;
- [`release-flow`](../release-flow/README.md) cuts, drafts and carries back a release with it;
- [`intellij/publish`](../intellij/README.md) reads a version's channel with it.

A workflow calls the actions, not `main.py`.

`main.py` checks a repository before and after a release, and writes what a release changes in it.\
It reads three things:

- the tags of the repository;
- `CHANGELOG.md` of the same repository;
- the version the release is asked to be, from the source the call names.

The first two work the same in every project.\
The third depends on the kind of project, as
[Where the version comes from](#where-the-version-comes-from) describes.

## Subcommands

`main.py` runs on the Python [`.python-version`](../.python-version) names, which the
actions install for themselves.\
No older Python is tested.

`main.py` has one subcommand per question a release asks:

| Subcommand        | What it does                                                                                                |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `version`         | checks whether the [candidate version](#where-the-version-comes-from) may be released next                  |
| `next`            | prints the version after a released one, with the source's [marker](#-snapshot-belongs-to-gradleproperties) |
| `changelog`       | checks that every released section of `CHANGELOG.md` still reads as its tag has it                          |
| `ancestry`        | checks that every release tag is still reachable from the current history                                   |
| `prefix`          | prints what release tags carry in front of the version                                                      |
| `channel`         | prints the [distribution channel](#the-channel-a-version-goes-to) of a version                              |
| `set-version`     | writes a version into the file the source declares it in                                                    |
| `close-changelog` | moves what is under `[Unreleased]` into a dated section for the version being released                      |
| `notes`           | prints the text of one released section, which is what its release notes say                               |

The options go after the subcommand name, and a subcommand refuses an option it never reads:

- `--version-source` and `--tag-prefix`: `version`, `next`, `changelog`, `ancestry`, `prefix` and
  `close-changelog`.\
  `close-changelog` reads them only with `--repository-url`, and takes them either way.
- `--version-source` alone: `set-version`.
- `--skip-unread-tags`: `changelog` alone, as [The changelog](#the-changelog) says.
- `--html`: `notes` alone.\
  It prints the section as HTML, rendered by cmark-gfm, the renderer GitHub's Markdown is built on.\
  Raw HTML in the section is left out, comments included.\
  It needs the packages in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt):
  `python3 -m pip install --require-hashes -r lib/requirements.txt`.
- Neither `--version-source` nor `--tag-prefix`: `notes` and `channel`.

## A release yet to land exits with 4

A release is published from its branch, `release/<version>`.\
It reaches the default branch only when `release-flow/merge-back` carries it there, or its pull
request does once merged.\
Until then its tag is off the default branch's history, and so is every commit made there in that
window.

`changelog`, `ancestry` and `version` tell such a release apart from one a rewrite took off the
history.\
A release is yet to land where all three hold:

- `release/<version>` holds its tag, as fetched or as a local branch.
- Every parent of the tagged commit is on the current history.\
  A force-push below the point the release was cut from fails this.
- `CHANGELOG.md` in the tree has no section for it.\
  A squash or a rebase merge copies the release commit, and the section with it.

Each check reports such a release as yet to land, naming the branch that holds it:

- `changelog` does not compare its section.
- `ancestry` does not blame a rewrite.
- `version`, where the candidate is that release, does not refuse it as released already.\
  The default branch still declares that version until merge-back writes the next one.

A check that finds nothing else exits with status 4, and with 1 where it finds more.\
`check-release` reads 4 as a warning.\
`release-flow/prepare` and `release-flow/merge-back` read it as a refusal, as any other status
but 0, so no release is prepared above one that has yet to land.

## Versions

A version is a semantic version: `1.0.0`, `1.0.0-rc.1`, `1.0.0-eap-2`, `1.0.0+dfsg1`.\
The grammar is the one SemVer 2.0.0 defines.\
A leading zero or an empty identifier is refused, because SemVer gives it no order.

### What `version` refuses

`version` refuses a candidate that:

- is not a semantic version;
- still carries the [`-SNAPSHOT` marker](#-snapshot-belongs-to-gradleproperties);
- does not come after the last release it is offered next to:
  - a final release has to come after the last final release;
  - a pre-release has to come after the highest release of any kind;
- has a core that is not one step past the last final release: after `0.2.0`, the next one is
  `0.2.1`, `0.3.0` or `1.0.0`, or a pre-release of one of them;
- moves less than [`[Unreleased]` asks for](#what-unreleased-asks-of-the-version).

A stable hotfix such as `0.2.1` may therefore go out while `0.3.0-beta.1` is open, from a branch
whose changelog does not hold the beta's section.\
Where it does, the beta's entries ask for a step as
[`[Unreleased]`'s do](#what-unreleased-asks-of-the-version).\
Where only pre-releases exist, the next version stays in their core: after `0.2.0-rc.1`, a later
pre-release of `0.2.0`, or `0.2.0` itself.\
With nothing released yet, any valid version may be the first.

### Build metadata does not order releases

Build metadata is the part after `+`, as in `1.0.0+dfsg1`.\
SemVer says it plays no part in ordering:

> Build metadata MUST be ignored when determining version precedence. Thus two versions that differ
> only in the build metadata, have the same precedence.

So `1.0.0+b` does not come after `1.0.0+a`, and releasing it after `1.0.0+a` is refused.\
The refusal says the two differ only in build metadata.
It does not say "does not come after", which would look like a bug for a version made later.

A project that needs `+dfsg1` to count as an upgrade needs an ordering SemVer does not define.\
That rule would go into `precedence()` in [`rules/versions.py`](rules/versions.py).

### The channel a version goes to

The channel is the first identifier of the pre-release suffix, or `default` for a final release.

- Identifiers are separated by dots.
- A hyphen is an ordinary character inside an identifier.
- Build metadata plays no part.

| Version       | Channel                 |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| `1.0.0`       | `default`               |
| `1.0.0-rc.1`  | `rc`                    |
| `1.0.0-eap-2` | `eap-2`, one of its own |
| `1.0.0-eap.2` | `eap`                   |

`channel` takes the version without the tag prefix: `0.3.0-beta.1`, not `v0.3.0-beta.1`.

## The changelog

`CHANGELOG.md` is read in the format of
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/):

- a `## [Unreleased]` section on top;
- a `## [<version>]` section for each release below it.

`close-changelog`, which `release-flow/prepare` runs, turns `[Unreleased]` into the section of the
release.
It refuses:

- a file with no `[Unreleased]` section;
- a version that already has a section;
- an `[Unreleased]` that says nothing, unless the release is a final one whose pre-releases to take
  in say something.\
  HTML comments say nothing: GitHub shows none of them.\
  Nor does a line where Python's `str.isprintable()` accepts none of its characters but the space:
  white space, a no-break space, a zero-width space or a soft hyphen alone say nothing, and
  `U+3164`, drawn blank, says something.\
  A link definition, such as `[//]: # (nothing removed yet)`, says nothing either: GitHub shows
  it nowhere.\
  A link counts as its text, `*`, `_` and `~` as nothing, as the marks of emphasis and strikethrough
  would, and a character reference such as `&nbsp;` as its character.
- an entry under `[Unreleased]` that says nothing on its line or in the lines of text right below
  it, indented as far as its text, such as `- <!-- what changed -->` left as a reminder, by its line
  number: released, it would be an empty bullet.\
  Any other line ends what is read, such as a blank line, a comment or a code block, and so does a
  line indented less: an entry whose text stands only past it is refused too, though GitHub may show
  that text.
- text that is read as saying nothing in a `###` group that holds nothing else but comments and
  link definitions, a comment's line with something after its `-->` included, by its line number:
  the group would be left out, and the text with it.\
  It is refused even where the entries of a pre-release taken in would keep the group.\
  A pre-release section closed by release-ci 0.2 or earlier was not checked for such text, nor for
  an entry that says nothing, so a final release that takes it in can leave its group out with them,
  or show such an entry as an empty bullet where its group says something.

Markdown is read only this far, not rendered, so the verdict can differ from GitHub's either way: an
`[Unreleased]` or an entry left empty by an HTML tag with nothing in it, or by a comment that runs
on over lines, can pass, and an entry of nothing but `*` is refused.

A `###` group with nothing under it, comments and link definitions aside, is left out of the
section instead.\
A link definition in it stays where the group stood, since a link elsewhere may use it.\
An `[Unreleased]` of nothing but such groups, as the Gradle changelog plugin leaves it after a
release, then says nothing and is refused.

A final release takes into its section the entries of every pre-release since the final release
before it, by SemVer's order.\
That includes an abandoned pre-release of another version: `1.0.0` after `0.3.0-beta.1` takes that
beta's entries in.\
A pre-release takes in nothing but its own entries.

`notes` prints a released section below its heading, without the link definitions in it.\
It follows the section with the definitions from anywhere in the file whose label the section names
in brackets, so a reference link such as `[the issue][1]` stays a link on the release page.\
Any text in brackets counts, so a definition can be printed by chance, such as one for a version
the text mentions as `[0.2.0]`: GitHub shows no definition, and only that text becomes a link.

The `changelog` check compares every released section with the copy in its release tag.

- `[Unreleased]` is not compared.
- Link definitions are not compared, wherever they stand: given a repository URL, a release
  rewrites the versions' own.\
  `notes` prints the ones a section names as the file holds them when it runs, so one edited later
  moves the changelog's link and not the release page's.\
  Adding or removing one inside a released section still fails the check: its line is left blank,
  not taken out, so the section's blank lines change.
- A release tagged before its section existed has nothing to compare, and is listed as not
  compared.
- A section that is missing because its tag is not on the current history is reported as such:
  the release has not reached this branch yet.\
  One still on its release branch is [awaited](#a-release-yet-to-land-exits-with-4), not failed.
- The copy at a tag is read down to the end of that release's section.\
  An older section below it is not read there.\
  A copy without that section is read whole.
- A line in the copy that `main.py` does not
  [read](#what-mainpy-reads-in-changelogmd), in the part that is read, fails the check.\
  A tag cannot be edited, so it fails on every run.\
  With `--skip-unread-tags`, the release is listed as not compared instead, with that line.\
  Where that line stands inside the release's own section, the tag holds the section, so a tree
  without it still fails.

### What `main.py` reads in `CHANGELOG.md`

`main.py` reads the file itself, without a Markdown library, and only the part of Markdown a
changelog needs.\
A line outside that part is refused, with its number and what to write instead.\
It is not guessed at: a line read differently from GitHub would count a heading or an entry where
GitHub shows none, or miss one it shows.\
In the copy at a release tag, which cannot be edited, the refusal does not say what to write
instead.\
The limits are `main.py`'s, not Keep a Changelog's, which says nothing of code or quotes.

Read:

- blank lines, and paragraphs, such as an introduction above the first section;
- headings of one to six `#`, with up to three spaces before them:
  `## [<label>]` opens a section, and `### <name>` a group within it;
- list items opened by `-`, `*`, `+`, or a number followed by `.` or `)`, nested in each other,
  with their lines continued, indented or not;
- fenced code blocks, between ` ``` ` or `~~~` lines, at the top or inside a list item:
  a heading or an entry inside one is code, not a section or an entry;
- HTML comments: one that starts a line or an item hides all up to its `-->`, lines below included;
  one that starts later in a line hides what it holds up to its `-->`, and is text where it does not
  close there, unless only closed comments stand before it in an item.\
  On a comment's own line, what follows `-->` is raw HTML: its Markdown is not read, a comment left
  open in it hides the rest of the line, and a character reference stands for its character.
- link definitions, `[label]: url` on a line of their own, outside list items, followed by a blank
  line or another definition.

Refused, with what to write instead:

| Refused                                                         | Write instead                      |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| an indented code block: four spaces more than its place         | a fenced code block                |
| five spaces or more after a list marker, an indented code block | one space after the marker         |
| a tab in a line's indentation                                   | spaces                             |
| a tab after a list marker                                       | a space                            |
| a block quote, `>`, starting a line or an item                  | a paragraph or a list item         |
| a line of only `=` or only `-`, which can underline a heading   | a heading of `#`s                  |
| a line of three or more `-`, `*` or `_`, a thematic break       | a heading, or nothing              |
| the delimiter row of a table, with `\|` or without, as `:-`     | a list                             |
| a footnote definition, `[^label]:`, starting a line or an item  | the note in the entry itself       |
| a heading inside a list item                                    | a heading above the list           |
| an empty list item                                              | a list item with text              |
| HTML starting a line or an item, other than a comment           | Markdown, or text before the HTML  |
| a link definition inside a list item                            | it outside the lists, on one line  |
| a link definition that goes on in the next line                 | the definition on one line         |
| a line right after a link definition                            | a blank line between them          |
| a fenced code block or a comment still open at the end          | its closing line                   |
| a line of a fence or a comment in a list item, left of its text | the indentation of the item's text |

A released section cannot be edited while its tag's copy is compared.\
A refused line in one is rewritten in the tree, and `--skip-unread-tags` then lists the release as
not compared: its tag still holds the line.

### What `[Unreleased]` asks of the version

The entries under `[Unreleased]` say how far the release has to move past the last final release.\
So do the entries of every pre-release above the last final release whose section the changelog
holds.\
The rule is [SemVer's rules 6 to 8](https://semver.org/#semantic-versioning-specification-semver),
applied to Keep a Changelog's kinds of change:

| Under `[Unreleased]`                                   | The release is at least              |
|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `### Added`, `### Changed`, `### Deprecated`           | a minor                              |
| `### Removed`, or an entry marked `**BREAKING**`       | a major, and a minor while below 1.0 |
| `### Fixed`, `### Security`, a group of any other name | a patch                              |

- `version` refuses a candidate that moves less, and names the group that asks for more.
- Under `tags` with no version given, the default is the version after the highest release.\
  Where `[Unreleased]` asks for more, it is the smallest version that satisfies it.
- An entry starting with `**BREAKING**` marks a change that breaks something a caller relied on,
  under whichever group it stands.\
  This is a convention of this repository: Keep a Changelog has no such marker.\
  A group such as release-please's `### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES` counts as a group of any other name.
- Below 1.0, a breaking change moves the minor, as Cargo and npm read `^0.y`.\
  SemVer's rule 4 promises nothing about `0.y.z`, and 1.0 is a step taken on purpose.
- A group with a name Keep a Changelog does not use, such as `### Documentation`, is named in a
  note on stderr.\
  A feature filed under a misspelled `### Add` can then still be seen.
- An empty group asks for nothing, and HTML comments and link definitions are ignored.\
  An entry or a line that says nothing counts as none, comments aside, by the measure that
  [refuses](#the-changelog) an `[Unreleased]` that says nothing.\
  That measure is no renderer: it can take for nothing raw HTML a browser shows after a comment's
  `-->`, such as `<!-- c --> <!--> The v1 API is gone.`, and so ask for a smaller step than that
  text calls for.\
  `close-changelog` refuses such a line under `[Unreleased]` in a group that holds nothing else, so
  the release stops there rather than go out with the smaller step.\
  A pre-release section closed by release-ci 0.2 or earlier was not checked for it, and can still
  ask for the smaller step.
- An entry under no group at all is refused, because nothing says what kind of change it is.
- A repository with no `CHANGELOG.md`, or no `[Unreleased]` section in it, is asked for no more
  than a patch, and told so on stderr.

## Where the version comes from

Every call that reads the source names it, with `--version-source` or the action's
`version-source` input.\
There is no default, because a wrong guess would pass silently.

Two sources exist:

| `--version-source`  | Where the candidate version comes from                                                         | After a release           |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `gradle.properties` | the `version` line of the file, or `--version`; a `-SNAPSHOT` at its end is dropped            | the next one written back |
| `tags`              | `--version`, or the version after the highest release, moved further where `[Unreleased]` asks | nothing written           |

The candidate version is the version `main.py version` checks against the rules.

### `-SNAPSHOT` belongs to `gradle.properties`

`-SNAPSHOT` is how Gradle and Maven mark a version that is not released yet.

- A release drops it from the end of the version.\
  This holds whether the version comes from the file, from `--version`, or from the `version` input
  of `check-release` or `release-flow/prepare`.
- A version given by hand may also leave it out.
- A version that still carries `SNAPSHOT` after that is refused, whatever the source:
  `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-SNAPSHOT`, `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT+b`, or `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT` given under `tags`.
- `tags` has no marker: the version after a release is worked out bare, and a source that has a
  marker adds it.

### The first release under `tags` needs a version

Under `tags`, with nothing released yet, there is no release to count from.\
Give the first version with `--version`, or with the `version` input of `check-release` or
`release-flow/prepare`.

### `set-version` under `tags` exits with 3

Under `tags` there is no file to write a version to.\
`set-version` then exits with status 3 instead of reporting a success.\
Its other refusals exit with 1, or 2 for a command line it cannot parse.\
So a caller can tell "nothing to write to" from a failed write.

### The tag prefix

`--tag-prefix` says what release tags carry in front of the version: `v` for `v0.1.0`.

- Under `gradle.properties`, unless `--tag-prefix` is given, the file declares it in a `tagPrefix`
  line, which it then has to have.\
  The two lines it needs are `version = 0.2.0-SNAPSHOT` and `tagPrefix = v`,
  or `tagPrefix =` where the tags have no prefix.\
  `--tag-prefix`, where given, overrides the file.
- Under `tags`, nothing declares it, so it has to be given.\
  `--tag-prefix ''` says the tags have no prefix, and so does `--tag-prefix '^none'`.
- Every action that takes `version-source` takes the prefix as its `tag-prefix` input, with
  `^none` for no prefix, as
  [the action's `tag-prefix`](../check-release/README.md#tag-prefix-is-left-out-where-the-source-declares-it)
  says.

#### No default tag prefix, on purpose

A wrong default would pass silently.\
A repository that tags bare versions, read as if it tagged `v*`, has no releases at all.\
Every check then passes, having compared nothing.\
The one exception is `version` under `tags` with no version given, which fails with no release to
count from.\
A caller that wants a default writes it in its own workflow, where its readers can see it.

### Adding a source

Each source is an adapter in [`lib/rules/sources.py`](rules/sources.py).\
The rules know none of them by name.

Adding `package.json`, `pyproject.toml` or `Cargo.toml` means one more adapter there:

- filed under the name `--version-source` gives it;
- its file declaring the tag prefix next to the version, as `gradle.properties` declares
  `tagPrefix`.

The rules need no change, unless the new source marks a version in progress with something other
than a `-SNAPSHOT` suffix.

A plain `VERSION` file has no room for a tag prefix.\
main.py asks every source with a file for one, unless `--tag-prefix` is given, so such a
file takes more than an adapter.

The top of [`rules/sources.py`](rules/sources.py) lists what an adapter has to answer, its file and
tag prefix included.\
[`lib/tests/test_sources.py`](tests/test_sources.py) holds every adapter to that list.\
It also needs a sample file for each adapter that declares a version.
