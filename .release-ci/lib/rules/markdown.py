"""The part of Markdown a changelog needs, read line by line, and a refusal for the rest.

GitHub reads CHANGELOG.md as GitHub Flavored Markdown, CommonMark 0.29 with extensions, in cmark-gfm.
Reading all of that takes a library, and reading it with patterns line by line gets it wrong in silence:
a `## [x]` inside a fenced code block counts as a section, a `- **BREAKING**` inside one as an entry.
So this reads a declared part of it, the way CommonMark reads it, and refuses every line outside that part
with its number and what to write instead. lib/README.md lists both.

Read:
- blank lines and paragraph text, continued lazily as CommonMark continues it;
- ATX headings, outside list items;
- list items, `-`, `*`, `+` or a number with `.` or `)`, nested, and their continuation lines;
- fenced code blocks, at the top or inside a list item;
- HTML comments, `<!--` to the line holding `-->`;
- link reference definitions on one line, outside list items, followed by a blank line or another definition.

The test against cmark-gfm in .github/test_changelog_reader.py holds this to GitHub's reading:
every text read here is split into the same headings, list items and code as cmark-gfm splits it.
