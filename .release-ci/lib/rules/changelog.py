    It is the counterpart of check_changelog: the section written here may never be edited again,
    because the tag is about to hold a copy of it.

    Refused rather than written:
    - a file with no `[Unreleased]` section: there is nothing to close;
    - a version that already has a section: this has run twice, or a section was written by hand,
      and closing again would bury one of them;
    - an `[Unreleased]` that says nothing, comments aside (see silent()): a release with nothing to say, and every
      later check would compare against that;
    - an entry under it that says nothing, comments aside, on its line or in the lines of text right below it, indented
      as far as its text (see item_says_something()), such as `- <!-- what changed -->` left as a reminder: the release
      notes would show an empty bullet.
      Any other line ends what is read, such as a blank line, a comment, a code block or a nested entry, and so does a
      line indented less: an entry whose text stands only past it is refused as well, though GitHub may show that text.
      Of several entries opened on one line, as in `- - <!-- c -->`, the last is the one asked about.
    - text read as saying nothing, comments aside, in a group of `[Unreleased]` that holds nothing else but comments and
      link definitions, a comment's line with something after its `-->` included: the group would be left out (see
      below), and the text with it, which the reading here may have got wrong.
      It is refused even where the entries of a pre-release taken in would keep the group.

    Markdown is read only this far, not rendered (see shown()), so the verdict can differ from GitHub's either way: an
    `[Unreleased]` or an entry left empty by an HTML tag with nothing in it, or by a comment that runs on over lines,
    can pass, and an entry of nothing but `*` is refused.

    A group that says nothing is left out of the section instead (see pruned()): an empty heading names no change.
    An `[Unreleased]` of nothing but such groups is then refused as saying nothing.

    Link definitions at the foot of the file belong to the file, not to the section, so they stay where they are.
    Changelogs with them and without them are both in use.
    Given the repository's URL, they are written afresh instead, as linked() writes them.

    A final release takes into its section the entries of every pre-release since the final release before it,
    in SemVer's order, whatever version they were for. That earlier final release is what compared_from gives.
    - Whoever skipped the betas reads everything 0.3.0 brings in one place.
    - 1.0.0 after an abandoned 0.3.0-beta.1 also says what that beta brought.
      semantic-release's notes for a final release likewise cover everything since the last final one.
    - A hotfix below an open train takes none of it, and a pre-release takes nothing in.
    - The pre-release sections stay as they were: released, and held to their tags.
    Emptiness is judged on the resulting section, so a train with nothing new to say at its end still closes.

    The Gradle changelog plugin's `combinePreReleases`, on by default, does the same only for pre-releases of
    the release's own version, and leaves an abandoned train out.
    Its code does not check that the release is a final one, so it would let 0.3.0-beta.2 take in 0.3.0-beta.1,
    repeating to a channel what it was already offered.
    Its documentation speaks of the final release, and so does this.
