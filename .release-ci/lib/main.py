"""Checks a repository before and after a release, and writes what a release changes in it.

- `version`: whether the candidate version may be released next,
  given the releases already tagged and what waits under `[Unreleased]`.
- `next`: the version that follows a released one, with the source's marker.
- `changelog`: whether every released section still reads as it did when it was released.
- `ancestry`: whether every release tag is still reachable. A history rewrite can take one off.
- `prefix`: what release tags carry in front of the version.
  Read from the source where it declares one, so that the workflows do not have to repeat it.
- `channel`: the distribution channel of a version, read off its pre-release suffix.
- `set-version`: write a version where the project declares it: the released one, then the next.
- `close-changelog`: move what is under `[Unreleased]` into a section of its own.
  This and `set-version` are what a release writes.
- `notes`: the text below one released section's heading, which is what its release notes say.

This file is the command line over the rules.
The rules are plain functions over text, so their tests need no repository to release:
- rules/versions.py: semantic versions, how they are ordered, and which one may follow which;
- rules/changelog.py: CHANGELOG.md, its sections, closing `[Unreleased]`, and its links;
- rules/markdown.py: which line of CHANGELOG.md is a heading, an entry or code, as GitHub reads it;
- rules/steps.py: how far the next version has to move.
rules/repository.py reads the repository: git, its files, and its release tags.
It also holds check_ancestry, the rule over which release tags this history reaches.
rules/sources.py holds one adapter per kind of repository, for where the version comes from.
