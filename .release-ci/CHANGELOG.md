# Changelog

Notable changes to this project, in the format of
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) - which is also the format
`check-release changelog` reads. A section that has been released is compared against the tag that
released it, so once a version has a section here, that section may not be edited again.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `lib/main.py --tag-prefix '^none'` says the tags have no prefix, as the actions'
  `tag-prefix` input does.
- `lib/main.py notes --html` prints a released section as HTML, rendered by cmark-gfm, for where
  Markdown is not read, such as a JetBrains plugin's change notes.\
  It needs the packages in `lib/requirements.txt`.
- **BREAKING** `intellij/build` checks that the signed archive's `plugin.xml` carries the version
  in the `version` line of `gradle.properties`, and stops where it does not.\
  A build script that took its version from anywhere else passed the build and the draft, and
  failed only once the release was published, in `intellij/publish`.\
  It runs Python for that, installed as every other action now installs it, under *Changed*.
- `intellij/check`, a plugin's CI without signing: `check` and `verifyPlugin`, as `intellij/build`
  runs them before it signs, with the Plugin Verifier's report kept.
- `change-notes` on `intellij/build`: the release's section of `CHANGELOG.md`, rendered as HTML,
  reaches the build in `CHANGE_NOTES`, and the signed archive's `plugin.xml` is checked to hold it.\
  A plugin's change notes then say what its release page says, without a renderer of its own.
- `skip-unread-tags` on `check-release`, `release-flow/prepare` and `release-flow/merge-back`, and
  `lib/main.py changelog --skip-unread-tags`: the `changelog` check names as not compared a release
  whose tag holds a line of `CHANGELOG.md` it does not read, instead of failing.\
  Where that line stands inside the release's own section, a tree without that section still fails.

### Changed

- **BREAKING** Every action that runs Python installs the version this repository's
  `.python-version` names with `actions/setup-python`, leaving the job's own `python3` as it was.\
  They ran on the runner's `python3`, which had to be 3.10 or later; below that they failed with a
  traceback.\
  In a job with a `container:`, that Python is built for the runner's system, not the image's: it
  starts in `ubuntu:24.04` on `ubuntu-latest`, and not in `debian:bookworm`.\
  Other images have not been tried.\
  A self-hosted runner needs a system `actions/setup-python` publishes a build for.\
  [UPGRADING.md](UPGRADING.md#actions-that-run-python-install-their-own) shows what that asks of a
  job.
- **BREAKING** The `source` input of `check-release`, `release-flow/prepare` and
  `release-flow/merge-back` is now `version-source`.\
  [UPGRADING.md](UPGRADING.md#the-source-input-is-now-version-source) shows the change.
- **BREAKING** `check-release/check-release.py` is now `lib/main.py`, beside the rules it runs.\
  Its `--source` is now `--version-source`.\
  It and `--tag-prefix` go after the command, and a command refuses the ones it never reads.\
  `channel` takes the version without the tag prefix.\
  [UPGRADING.md](UPGRADING.md#check-releasecheck-releasepy-is-now-libmainpy) shows the new calls.
- **BREAKING** `check-release version` holds the version to what `[Unreleased]` asks for:
  - `### Added`, `### Changed` or `### Deprecated` asks for at least a minor.
  - `### Removed`, or an entry that starts with `**BREAKING**`, asks for a major, or a minor below
    1.0.
  - Under an open pre-release train, the train's sections in the changelog ask as well.
  - A release that moves less is refused, and so is one with an entry under no `###` group.
  - Under `tags`, with no version given, the default is the version after the highest release, or
    the least version `[Unreleased]` allows where that is further.
- `close-changelog` puts into a final release the entries of every pre-release since the final
  release before it, in SemVer order, whatever version they were for.\
  It took in only the pre-releases of that version: `1.0.0` after an abandoned `0.3.0-beta.1` left
  that beta's entries out.
- `close-changelog --repository-url` compares a final release from the final release before it,
  skipping the pre-releases whose entries its section took in.\
  The link of `0.3.0` after `0.3.0-beta.2` showed only the commits since `0.3.0-beta.2`, not the
  train its section took in.\
  A pre-release compares from the release before it, which after a hotfix is the one before it in
  its train.\
  "Before" means SemVer order, not the order in the file.

### Removed

- **BREAKING** `release-flow/draft`: the `source` and `tag-prefix` inputs, which it no longer reads.

### Fixed

- `intellij/build` leaves the calling job's `JAVA_HOME` and `java` as they were: its Gradle steps
  get the JDK it sets up through a `JAVA_HOME` of their own.\
  It made that JDK the default for every later step of the job.
- **BREAKING** `lib/main.py` reads `CHANGELOG.md` as CommonMark does, but only the part of Markdown
  a changelog needs, and every command that reads the file refuses a line outside that part, with
  its number and what to write instead.\
  [What `main.py` reads in `CHANGELOG.md`](lib/README.md#what-mainpy-reads-in-changelogmd) lists
  both.\
  `changelog` refuses such a line in the copy at a release tag too, down to the end of that
  release's section, or anywhere in a copy without it.\
  That copy cannot be edited, so the refusal there does not say what to write instead.\
  A `## [x]` or `###` heading inside a fenced code block or an HTML comment was read as a section or
  a group.\
  A line that only began like a link definition, such as `[scope]: entry text`, was left out of the
  release notes and of what the `changelog` check compares.
- `close-changelog` and `notes` refuse as empty an `[Unreleased]` or a section with no character
  `str.isprintable()` accepts but the space, HTML comments aside, such as one of zero-width spaces
  or one holding only `<!-- what changed -->`.\
  `close-changelog` takes a link definition for nothing too, wherever it stands.\
  Both took only white space and link definitions for nothing, `close-changelog` only a definition
  at the end of `[Unreleased]`, so such a section was released with empty notes.
- `close-changelog` refuses an entry under `[Unreleased]` that says nothing, HTML comments aside, on
  its line or in the lines of text right below it, indented as far as its text, such as
  `- <!-- what changed -->` left as a reminder, naming its line.\
  It was released as an empty bullet.
- `close-changelog` leaves out of the section a `###` group with nothing under it, HTML comments
  and link definitions aside.\
  It was released as a heading with nothing under it.\
  A link definition in it stays where the group stood.\
  Text in such a group that is read as saying nothing is refused by its line instead of being left
  out with it, since GitHub may show it.
- `close-changelog` writes empty the blank lines after the last entry under `[Unreleased]`.\
  One holding spaces was written back below the new section as a line of spaces.
- `intellij/publish`: `attempts` and `wait` have to be whole numbers, `attempts` from 1 to 9999,
  checked before the upload.\
  An `attempts` that was no number made no attempt, and the run failed as though the version was
  not served.\
  A `wait` that was no number left the attempts with no pause between them.
- `check-release`: a glob in `checks`, such as `*`, is refused under its own name.\
  It used to be expanded to the files in the workspace, and the error named those instead.
- A `tagPrefix` in `gradle.properties` holding an unpaired `\uD800`-`\uDFFF` escape is refused.\
  `prefix` ended in a traceback printing it, and the other checks passed having found no release.
- A command-line argument holding a byte that does not decode is refused by name, before any
  command runs.\
  `set-version` ended in a traceback, and `close-changelog` in one that left `CHANGELOG.md` empty.
- `set-version` and `close-changelog` write a CRLF file back with CRLF line endings.\
  They wrote every line back as LF, so a release commit rewrote the whole file to change one line.
- `CHANGELOG.md` headings are read as CommonMark reads them in these cases too:
  - A heading indented by up to three spaces, or with a tab after its `#`s, is a heading.
  - A `###` heading closed by a run of `#`s is read without them.

  `close-changelog` found no indented `## [Unreleased]`.\
  A final release that took in its train listed a pre-release's indented or closed `### Added` apart
  from its own.
- `notes` follows the section with the link definitions it names, from wherever they stand in
  `CHANGELOG.md`.\
  It left them out, so a reference link such as `[the issue][1]` showed on the release page as
  written.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-29

### Added

- `release-flow/warn`, which says at the top of a published release's notes that publishing it
  somewhere other than GitHub did not complete, linking the run, and takes that back once a run
  repeated later publishes it.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-29

### Added

- `check-release`, the rules a release has to pass, as subcommands over a repository: which version
  may be released next, whether a released changelog section still reads as it was released, whether
  every released tag is still reachable, which distribution channel a version goes to, what release
  tags are called, which version follows a released one, and what a release writes back.
- `--source`, which says where the version a release is asked to be comes from: `gradle.properties`,
  or `tags` for a repository that declares no version: it is handed one, or takes the one after its
  highest release.
- `--tag-prefix`, which says what release tags carry in front of the version, for a source that
  declares no prefix of its own.
- `check-release/action.yml`, a composite action, so a project asks for the rules rather than keeping
  a copy of them.
- A note, on stderr, where a tag prefix counts none of the tags a repository carries: every check
  over the empty list but `version` under `tags` with no version given still passes, and the note
  says there is no release to compare against.
- `release-flow/merge-back`, which carries a published release back onto the default branch by
  fast-forward, and offers a pull request where it cannot.
- `close-changelog`, which moves what is under `[Unreleased]` into a released section of its own,
  dated, the way the Gradle changelog plugin does.
- `release-flow/prepare`, which cuts the release commit onto a branch of its own: `[Unreleased]`
  closed into a section for the version, the version written back where the source declares one, and
  nothing pushed.
- `notes`, which prints one released section without its heading, so the release notes and the
  changelog cannot come to say different things.
- `release-flow/draft`, which pushes the release branch and drafts the release from it once the build
  has succeeded.
- `intellij`, the first ecosystem: building and signing a JetBrains plugin between prepare and draft,
  and publishing it to the Marketplace once its draft is published.
