"""lib/rules/markdown.py reads every text it accepts the way GitHub does.

Each text the reader accepts is rendered by cmarkgfm, the Python binding of GitHub's own cmark-gfm, with the
source positions of every block, and the two have to agree on which lines are headings and of which level, which
lines start list items, and which lines are code.
A line of text has to stand in one of cmark-gfm's paragraphs or list items, and a line of a comment outside its
paragraphs, headings and code.
A line that starts as a link definition does, `[label]:` and an address, has to be hidden by cmark-gfm where the
reader reads a definition, and shown where it reads text.
The texts are this repository's CHANGELOG.md as it stood at every commit, written cases, and documents put together
at random from lines a changelog could hold.
cmark-gfm passes no raw HTML through here: a comment it passed on as `<!-->` would read to HTMLParser as one still
open, and hide the blocks after it.
It reads footnotes, as GitHub does.

Run with `python3 -m unittest discover -s .github` from the repository's root, with the packages in
`lib/requirements.txt` and `.github/requirements.txt` installed.
