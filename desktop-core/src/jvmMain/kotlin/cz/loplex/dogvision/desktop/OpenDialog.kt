/**
 * The dialog a window opens a photo or a video from, or picks a [folder] in, one at a time, which starts beside the
 * file shown, or in the folder shown, if any.
 *
 * On Linux it is kdialog's on KDE and zenity's elsewhere, either where the other is missing, each run as a program of
 * its own, and AWT's FileDialog where neither is on the PATH, and on Windows. The JDK's GTK dialog comes up below the
 * window on KDE from its second opening on: its window keeps the time of the first one's last use, which KWin's focus
 * stealing prevention takes as older than the click into the window. A program started afresh has no such time, so
 * its dialog comes up on top. tinyfiledialogs picks its dialog the same way.
 *
 * [command] is what asks for a file, if anything does, [run] runs it and says what was picked, and [fallback] shows
 * AWT's dialog, or Swing's for a folder, which AWT's cannot pick on Linux and Windows, worded in the texts it is given;
 * the tests give their own of each, and a [post] that runs what it is given there and then.
