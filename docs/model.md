# The model

What the simulation does to a picture, for which species, from which measurements, and what it
cannot show. Every program here runs the same model, from [`core`](../core); the controls that set
it are in [Using it](using.md).

- [Species](#species) — every species, its cone peaks, its S-cone share and their sources, and how
  each sees a test chart.
- [How it works](#how-it-works) — the model in five steps, and the matrix they make.
- [Colour saturation](#colour-saturation) — `fixed` or `rnl`, and what the second rests on.
- [Acuity](#acuity) — blurring to what each species resolves, and when that shows.
- [Map of differences](#map-of-differences) — where two views differ noticeably, and by what
  measure.
- [What it cannot show](#what-it-cannot-show) — the limits, grouped by whether they can be lifted.
- [References](#references) — every source in full.

## Species

Peaks are the wavelengths of maximum cone sensitivity as measured in each source.
A dichromat's longer cone is listed under L whatever it is called elsewhere, and a cone monochromat
has only that one, so it sees shades of grey.
The S-cone share is used only by the [`rnl` colour saturation](#colour-saturation); where a
source reports a range across the retina, the middle of it is used, and a star marks a species
with no measurement found, which gets the assumed 10 %.

The first column is the value `--species` takes on the command line and in the desktop window; the
app, the web page and the windows list the same species by name, in this order.
The rows are [`Species.kt`](../core/src/commonMain/kotlin/cz/loplex/dogvision/core/Species.kt), and
[a test fails](developing.md#the-documents-are-checked-against-core) when the two differ.

Notes on the human and primate rows:

- `protanope` and `deuteranope` are humans lacking the L or the M cone; their values are the human
  pigment peaks.
- `protanomalous` and `deuteranomalous` are anomalous trichromats of moderate severity: the L or the
  M cone is shifted 10 nm towards the other.
  Machado, Oliveira & Fernandes (2009) model severity the same way, with a 20 nm shift standing for
  dichromacy.
- `human` is normal colour vision, and the reference the [`rnl` scale](#colour-saturation) measures
  every other species against, so both its images are the original.
- `marmoset-female` is a female with the 543 nm and 563 nm variants of the M/L pigment; males, and
  females with two copies of one variant, are dichromats.
- Every trichromat is given one L cone per M cone. Humans with normal colour vision range from about
  twice as many L as M cones to the reverse (Roorda & Williams 1999).

### How each species sees a test chart

![A hue sweep and eight colour patches as every species sees them, with both colour
saturation scales](images/species-grid.png)

### Why most mammals look alike

- **They share the same two cone genes.** Every dichromatic mammal here inherited one S and one L
  pigment from a common ancestor; species differ only in how those are tuned, by a few tens of
  nanometres at most.
- **Cone sensitivities are broad**, about 100 nm wide at half height, so a shift of 10 nm changes
  little.
- **The visible differences are small but real:** reds are darker for an L cone at shorter
  wavelengths (horse, ground squirrel), and the hue a species sees as white moves along the sweep.
- **The large steps are between kinds of colour vision** — trichromat, dichromat, monochromat — not
  between species of one kind.

## How it works

The method is the one Brettel, Viénot & Mollon (1997) use for human dichromats:

1. Each cone is modelled with the Govardovskii et al. (2000) pigment template, from its peak alone.
2. The display is three Gaussian primaries,
   balanced so that white excites human cones like daylight.
3. That gives a matrix from linear RGB to the animal's cone excitations.
   For a dichromat it has one direction it cannot see:
   colours differing only along it look the same.
4. Each pixel is moved along that direction onto the plane R = G, which holds the grey axis and
   the blue–yellow axis.
   Neutral colours therefore stay neutral, and the animal's cones respond to the output exactly as
   to the input.
   A monochromat is moved onto the grey axis instead.
5. Adaptation and strength scale and blend the result.

The saturation of the result is then set by one of two [scales](#colour-saturation).

The whole transform is one 3×3 matrix on linear RGB.
The comment at the top of [`Model.kt`](../core/src/commonMain/kotlin/cz/loplex/dogvision/core/Model.kt)
states it step by step.

## Colour saturation

Step 4 fixes which colours merge, but not how saturated the rest look: the plane has no natural
scale.
*Colour saturation*, or `--chroma-scale` on the command line, picks one of two:

| `--chroma-scale` | Control                           | Saturation of the animal's colour axes |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `fixed`          | *Fixed by the projection*         | as the projection leaves it            |
| `rnl`            | *Matched to discrimination (RNL)* | matched to what the animal tells apart |

- **`fixed` is the default.**
- **`rnl` scales the axes** so that a step the animal can just tell apart is one a human can.

A dichromat has one colour axis, blue–yellow. A trichromat has two, and for it `fixed` leaves the
image as it is, since nothing merges: `rnl` is the only way it looks different.

`rnl` counts just-noticeable differences (JNDs) the same way for the animal and for a human:

- **Both are judged by the receptor noise limited (RNL) model** of Vorobyev & Osorio (1998), around
  grey.
  It turns each cone's noise, set by the share of cones of that class, into a JND.
- **The human is a normal trichromat** looking at the output, with the `human` row's cones and
  shares.
- **The output is rescaled until the two counts agree.** The lightness is untouched.
  A trichromat has two axes: blue–yellow keeps its hue, as in the `fixed` scale, and changes only
  in saturation, while the other axis takes up the rest of the difference.
  *Selected species* shows the factors for the species chosen, as its *RNL scale*.
- **`human` therefore comes out exactly as the original**, and an animal shows how its
  discrimination compares with ours: below 1 it tells colours apart worse, above 1 better.

### Caveat: the animal's cones are assumed to be as noisy as ours

- **RNL needs each cone's noise as a Weber fraction**, and that is measured for almost no mammal.
  Taking the same value for animal and human makes it cancel, so none has to be chosen; the
  assumption is that it is the same.
- **Some S-cone shares are assumed**, marked with a star in the [species table](#species), and every
  trichromat's L:M ratio is.
- **RNL is a threshold model.** It is matched near grey; strongly saturated colours are
  extrapolated.
- **Monochromats** have no chromatic axis, so both scales give the same grey image.

## Acuity

*Blur to the species' acuity*, or `--acuity` on the command line, removes the detail finer than the
species resolves, the way AcuityView does (Caves & Johnsen 2018): the image is filtered with the
modulation transfer function exp(−3.56 (f / acuity)²), f in cycles per degree, which is a Gaussian
blur in linear light.

- **Cattle resolve detail side by side better than one above another**; their pupil is a horizontal
  oval, and the blur is stretched accordingly.
- **A range in the source** (sheep, tree squirrel) is replaced by its middle, and the source column
  says so.
- **Species without a measurement** are left sharp, and *Selected species* says so.

### Caveat: the blur needs to know how wide the image is in degrees

- ***Image spans [degrees]*, or `--fov`, is that angle**, 60° by default, which is typical of a
  camera but only a guess for a photo. Halving it halves the blur.
- **An image shows the blur only if it has more pixels per degree than the species resolves.**
  An image 640 pixels wide spanning 60° has about 11 pixels per degree,
  so a dog's blur is under half a pixel and invisible,
  while a 4000-pixel photo of the same scene blurs it by over two pixels.
- **The result is right when it is seen at the angle it spans.** Viewed smaller, the viewer's own
  acuity blurs it further; viewed larger, blur a human would not notice becomes visible.

## Map of differences

*Map of differences*, or `--difference` on the command line, adds a third image beside the two:

- **Grey** where the two images look the same.
- **Red** where they differ by more than one just-noticeable difference, deeper the larger the
  difference; the map's caption gives the share of pixels that do.

![The apples as a deuteranope and as a dog see them, and the map marking the red apples, which the
dog sees in a slightly different shade](images/apples-difference.png)

It compares the two images as a human sees them, in CIELAB, where one just-noticeable difference is
about ΔE\*ab 2.3 (Mahy et al. 1994).
That catches differences in colour and in sharpness alike.

### Caveat: it measures the two images, not the two animals

- **A human looks at both images**, so the map says what differs between two renderings, each
  already reduced to what its animal can tell apart.
- **ΔE\*ab 2.3 is an average.** The true threshold varies across colour space, so the edge of the
  red region is approximate.
- **Camera noise differs between a sharp and a blurred image**, so with the acuity blur on, noise
  shows up as scattered red specks.

## What it cannot show

### Permanent: the information is not in the picture

- **Animals with an ultraviolet cone** — mice, rats, birds, bees — are left out.
  An RGB camera records nothing of what that cone sees.
- **For trichromats only the spacing of colours can change.** The camera is itself trichromatic, so
  two colours it records differently also excite a trichromat's cones differently: nothing merges.
  The `rnl` scale shows how far apart they look instead.
- **Colours a camera merges** stay merged. Two surfaces that look alike to a human, and so to the
  camera, can differ for the animal.
- **What the colours feel like** to the animal is unknowable. The simulation shows which colours
  it cannot tell apart, and nothing more.

### By design: the model is simpler than the eye

- **The lens and the macular pigment are ignored.**
  This is the likely reason the model puts the human deuteranope's neutral point well short of the
  measured value of about 505 nm, while it matches the dog's 480 nm
  (both from Neitz, Geist & Jacobs 1989).
- **The display primaries are generic**, not those of the screen in front of you.
- **Blue–yellow is a convention.** Which human hues stand for a dichromat's single chromatic axis
  is not fixed by physics.
- **Colour and acuity are simulated** — not motion sensitivity or dim-light vision.
