# Developing dog-vision

How the code is laid out, and how a change is checked.
Building the programs is [Building it](building.md)'s.

- [How the code is laid out](#how-the-code-is-laid-out) — the modules, their layers and which uses
  which, and the GPU renderer they share.
- [Checking it](#checking-it) — what each Gradle task tests, the documents held to `core`, the
  Kotlin style, detekt, the tests' coverage, and what GitHub Actions runs.
- The caveats: [the emulator's colours](#caveat-the-emulator-fails-the-video-tests-colour-checks),
  and [Windows without a GPU and
  under Wine](#caveat-windows-is-tested-without-a-gpu-and-under-wine).
- [Where the test data comes from](#where-the-test-data-comes-from) — the test videos and the
  reference values.

## How the code is laid out

| Module                            | Holds                                      | Built for           |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------|

| [`gl`](../gl)                     | the GLSL ES 3.00 passes that render a view | the JVM, JavaScript |
| [`texts`](../texts)               | the wording, in English and Czech          | the JVM, JavaScript |

| [`android`](../android)           | the Android app                            | Android             |
| [`web`](../web)                   | the web page                               | JavaScript          |
| [`cli`](../cli)                   | the command line                           | the JVM             |
| [`jvm-common`](../jvm-common)     | what the command line and windows share    | the JVM             |
| [`gui-core`](../gui-core)         | what the desktop windows share             | the JVM             |
| [`ffmpeg`](../ffmpeg)             | ffmpeg and ffprobe, found and run          | the JVM             |
| [`gui-compose`](../gui-compose)   | the desktop window, in Compose             | the JVM             |
| [`gui-swing`](../gui-swing)       | the desktop window, in Swing               | the JVM             |
| [`packaging`](../packaging)       | the debs, the rpms, the MSI and the zip    | Linux, Windows      |
| [`testing`](../testing)           | what the renderers' tests hold them to     | the JVM, JavaScript |

[`build-logic`](../build-logic) is no module but a Gradle build of its own, included in this one.
It holds:

- the tasks the Linux packages and the MSI are made with, which a module takes by applying the
  plugin `cz.loplex.dogvision.packaging`;
- [`windowPackages`](../build-logic/src/main/kotlin/cz/loplex/dogvision/packaging/linux/WindowPackages.kt),
  which registers them for a window's deb and rpm, once for both windows;
- [`glNatives` and `windowsRuntime`](../build-logic/src/main/kotlin/cz/loplex/dogvision/packaging/jvm/DesktopNatives.kt),
  the natives that `gui-core`'s tests and the windows run with;
- [`artifact()`](../build-logic/src/main/kotlin/cz/loplex/dogvision/packaging/Artifact.kt), which
  marks a task that makes an artifact, for `./gradlew packageAll` to run.

The root project declares the plugin, so these are on every module's build script classpath.

- **`core` has no platform in it**: the species, the model and the image pipeline, with no video
  and no window's session.
  The one part written for each platform is how a fact's number is rounded, in
  [`Facts.jvm.kt`](../core/src/jvmMain/kotlin/cz/loplex/dogvision/core/Facts.jvm.kt) and
  [`Facts.js.kt`](../core/src/jsMain/kotlin/cz/loplex/dogvision/core/Facts.js.kt), since JavaScript
  has no `BigDecimal`.
- **`gl`'s passes run on every GPU the programs draw on**: OpenGL ES 3.0 on Android, WebGL 2 in the
  browser, and EGL, ANGLE or WGL on the desktop.
  [`ViewPasses`](../gl/src/commonMain/kotlin/cz/loplex/dogvision/gl/ViewPasses.kt) runs them
  through [`Gl`](../gl/src/commonMain/kotlin/cz/loplex/dogvision/gl/Gl.kt), the part of OpenGL ES
  3.0 they need, which each program implements.
- **`texts`' strings are in [`texts/strings`](../texts/strings)**, in Android's `strings.xml`
  format, which the build compiles into Kotlin, each named by an entry of the enum `Str` or
  `Plural`.
  The app, the web page, the window and the command line all speak through it.
- **`ui`'s Compose Multiplatform 1.12 is Jetpack Compose 1.12**, and its Material 3 1.9 is androidx
  Material 3 1.4, the versions of the app's Compose BOM, so that the app runs one of each.
- **The command line and the windows take options of their own**, and share the view's:
  [`jvm-common`'s `ViewOptions`](../jvm-common/src/jvmMain/kotlin/cz/loplex/dogvision/common/Options.kt)
  reads them for both, and
  [`gui-core`'s `runWindow`](../gui-core/src/jvmMain/kotlin/cz/loplex/dogvision/desktop/WindowArguments.kt)
  answers a window's `--help` and a command line it cannot read, and opens the window on the rest.
- **`gui-core` has no toolkit in it**, neither Compose nor skiko: the GL contexts, the passes'
  renderer, ffmpeg's feeds, and the pixels read back handed to a function that makes the window's
  image of them.
  Its `LiveSession` holds what a window shows, so that the Compose
  window and the Swing one only lay it out.
- **`ffmpeg` finds ffmpeg and ffprobe and starts them**:
  on the PATH, where they were installed after a window started, or on Windows where a window
  downloaded them.
  Through them it probes a video, reads its frames and writes an .mp4, for a conversion.

### Which module uses which

The modules stand in six layers, each a row of the graphs named on its left, and a module's code
uses only modules in the layers below its own:

1. the foundations: `core`, the model, and `ffmpeg`, which uses no other module;
2. what is built on the model: `gl`, `texts` and, for tests, `testing`;
3. what the command line and the windows share: `jvm-common`;
4. what the app and the windows are built on: `ui` and `gui-core`;
5. the programs;
6. the packages: `packaging`, which takes the programs.

A module may reach past a layer, as `android` reaches `core`.

An arrow points from a module to one it uses:

- **a thick arrow is `api`**: whatever uses the module gets the one it points at too;
- **a thin arrow is `implementation`**: the module keeps the one it points at to itself;
- **a dashed arrow is for tests alone**: the module's tests use it, and its code does not.

A module in bold is a program: its build makes something to run, the app's APK, the web page, or
the packages of the command line and the windows.
Under its name, in small letters, is what it is, as the table in
[How the code is laid out](#how-the-code-is-laid-out) says.

What each module uses, less `texts` and the tests:

![What each module uses, less texts and the tests](modules/uses.svg)

What uses `texts`:

![What uses texts](modules/texts.svg)

What uses `testing`, in tests alone:

![What uses testing, in tests alone](modules/testing.svg)

What the packages take, which `packaging` makes of the windows, the command line and the web page:

![What the packages take](modules/packaging.svg)

- **`texts` has a graph of its own, as with it in the first one lines have to cross**, however the
  modules are placed:
  `android`, `web`, and `jvm-common` with `gui-core`, are three that each reach the same three,
  `core`, `gl` and `texts`, and no drawing on a plane joins three to three without a crossing.
  Without `texts` the first graph has two crossings, the fewest it can have with each layer a row
  of its own.
- **`jvm-common` holds what the command line and the windows share**: the view's options, which
  each reads from its command line, a photo read as it is meant to be seen, and a photo or a
  video converted at full size.
- **`gui-compose`, `gui-swing` and `cli` reach `core` and `texts` through what they share**: the
  windows through `gui-core`, which passes on `jvm-common`, and `cli` through `jvm-common`, which
  passes on the two.
- **`ui` passes on `texts`**, as its `text` and `InfoButton` take an entry of `texts`' `Str`.
- **`packaging` has no code of its own**: it takes from the module that has them the JARs a Linux
  package installs, through `jvmRuntimeOf`, as a module takes a library's, each launcher of a
  package for Windows, its JAR and what it runs on, through the module's `windowsLauncher` task,
  and the web page through the variant `webPage` registers in `web`.
- **Only tests use `testing`**, so no program ships it.
  `core`'s tests use `testing`, which in turn uses `core`; Gradle builds `core` itself first, as
  its code does not use `testing`.
- **Each graph is drawn by Graphviz from its source in [`docs/modules`](modules)**, a `.dot` file:
  `./gradlew drawModuleGraphs` runs Graphviz's `dot` on each into the SVG shown here, and writes
  the `.dot`'s SHA-256 into it.
- **`./gradlew checkModuleGraph` holds the four graphs together to the modules' build files**, and
  runs in `check`: every arrow declared is drawn in one of them, and none is drawn that is not.
  It holds the layers too: an arrow but a dashed one points into a row below its own.
  It holds each SVG to its `.dot` through the SHA-256, and fails when the `.dot` has changed since,
  so it needs no Graphviz.

### The view is rendered on the GPU, and a photo at full size on the CPU

- **The view is drawn by `gl`'s shaders**, which apply `core`'s matrix and blur, and decode and
  encode sRGB through `core`'s own lookup tables, so that they agree with it to the rounding of a
  float.
- **In the app, the same passes draw every view there is**: the screen, a recording, which the
  renderer draws into an encoder's surface as well, and a video converted at full size, through the
  Media3 effect [`ViewEffect`](../android/src/main/kotlin/cz/loplex/dogvision/video/ViewEffect.kt).
- **The desktop window renders in a GL context with no window of its own**, and reads the view back
  into the Compose window without waiting for the GPU.
- **A photo saved at full size goes through `core`'s CPU pipeline**, a strip of rows at a time,
  which has no limit on the size of a texture.

## Checking it

`./gradlew check` runs every test task below that needs no phone, Android Lint, the Kotlin style,
[detekt](#detekt-looks-for-likely-bugs-and-code-smells),
the check of [the modules' graphs](#which-module-uses-which), and that of
[the artifacts' folders](building.md#every-artifact-at-once).
The test classes' comments say what each of them holds.

| Task                                           | Tests                                                |
|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `./gradlew :core:jvmTest`                      | the model, against the reference values              |
| `./gradlew :core:allTests`                     | the same, and the JVM and Node.js agreeing           |
| `./gradlew :texts:allTests`                    | every language's strings, plurals, system languages  |
| `./gradlew :ui:jvmTest`                        | the shared controls, in Compose's test scene         |
| `./gradlew :jvm-common:jvmTest`                | EXIF, photos read, converted files, progress, cancel |
| `./gradlew :cli:jvmTest`                       | the options, photo and video, the figures            |
| `./gradlew :gui-core:jvmTest`                  | the window's passes, GL contexts, ffmpeg, session    |
| `./gradlew :ffmpeg:jvmTest`                    | finding ffmpeg, its download, video read and written |
| `./gradlew :gui-swing:jvmTest`                 | image, theme, a drop, controls, menus, wrapped text  |
| `./gradlew :web:jsTest`                        | the page's passes, snapshot and recording            |
| `./gradlew :android:connectedDebugAndroidTest` | the renderer, recording and conversion, on a device  |
| `./gradlew :android:lintDebug`                 | Android Lint alone                                   |

- **The renderers' tests hold each GPU renderer to `core`'s CPU pipeline**: the app's, the web
  page's and the window's alike, through [`testing`](../testing)'s reference pattern.
- **`:gui-core:jvmTest` draws on this machine's GPU**, through EGL on Linux and through
  ANGLE and WGL on Windows, and runs the machine's `ffmpeg`.
- **`:cli:jvmTest`, `:jvm-common:jvmTest` and `:ffmpeg:jvmTest` run the machine's `ffmpeg` too**,
  to make the videos they convert, read and write.
- **`:web:jsTest` runs in headless Chrome, which renders WebGL 2 in software**, with SwiftShader, as
  [`karma.config.d/webgl.js`](../web/karma.config.d/webgl.js) tells it to.
  `./gradlew :web:jsTest -PwebTestsOnGpu` runs the tests on the GPU instead,
  through ANGLE on Vulkan.
- **`:android:connectedDebugAndroidTest` runs on the connected phone or emulator**, on its GPU and
  codecs.
- **`python3 tools/check_links.py` checks the Markdown**, which `check` does not: every relative
  link resolves, down to its anchor.

### The documents are checked against core

- **`ModelDocTest`, in `:core:jvmTest`, holds [The model](model.md) to `Species`**: both its tables
  list every species, in order, with the peaks, S-cone shares, acuities and sources `core` has,
  formatted as `core` formats them, and the neutral points it quotes still hold.
- **`FiguresTest`, in `:cli:jvmTest`, holds the figures in [`docs/images`](images) to what `core`
  renders**, within 2 in each channel; the captions are left out, as fonts differ between systems.
- **`./gradlew :cli:renderFigures` renders the figures again**, from the apple photo beside them;
  [`Figures.kt`](../cli/src/jvmTest/kotlin/cz/loplex/dogvision/cli/Figures.kt) says what each
  shows.
- **The screenshots are not checked, but
  [`tools/take_screenshots.sh`](../tools/take_screenshots.sh) takes them again**, each in English
  with the apple photo open: `window.png` and `window-swing.png` under Xvfb at 1400 x 820, `web.png`
  in headless Chrome at the same size, and `android.png` on the device adb sees, by
  `DocsScreenshotTest` in `:android:connectedDebugAndroidTest`, which writes what the app draws
  between the system's bars, scaled to 580 wide.
  The documents' `android.png` comes from an emulator with Android 17 and a screen of 1080 x 2400
  at 420 dpi; the windows' fonts and widgets are the machine's, so their pixels differ between
  machines.

### The Kotlin style is ktlint's

The style is [ktlint](https://pinterest.github.io/ktlint/)'s, as IntelliJ IDEA formats Kotlin, set
in [`.editorconfig`](../.editorconfig):

- `./gradlew ktlintCheck` checks it, and `./gradlew ktlintFormat` fixes what it can;
  `build-logic`'s own are `:build-logic:ktlintCheck` and `:build-logic:ktlintFormat`, and
  `./gradlew check` runs `build-logic`'s;
- `./gradlew checkLineLength` holds every line of Kotlin to 120 characters, comments included:
  ktlint does not measure a line that is a comment and nothing else.
  It holds the Markdown's lines to 100 as well, but for code blocks and tables, and without the
  links' targets, none of which can be broken.

### detekt looks for likely bugs and code smells

[detekt](https://detekt.dev/) checks every module's Kotlin but the app's, which Android Lint checks:

- **`check` runs it over every source set**, with the types of the JVM and Android compilations
  where a module has them, and alone over the JS ones; `./gradlew detekt` alone checks nothing in
  these modules, as their code is not in `src/main`.
- **Its rules are detekt's defaults**, but where [`detekt.yml`](../detekt.yml) says otherwise:
  a composable function is left out of the naming, length and parameter rules, as Compose names and
  lays out its own that way, and a class of tests out of LargeClass, as it holds every test of its
  subject.
- **A finding that stays is suppressed where it stands**, with `@Suppress` on its declaration, or
  on its file where the file's numbers are data, with a comment saying so; no rule is switched off
  for the whole build.
- **It analyses an `expect` and its `actual` as two declarations in one module**, and reports them
  as compiler errors in `core`, `texts` and `ui`, the modules that have both; it goes on, less
  accurate there.

### The JVM tests' coverage is measured, not required

- **`./gradlew koverHtmlReport` writes which lines and branches the JVM tests reach**, for `cli`,
  `core`, `ffmpeg`, `gl`, `gui-compose`, `gui-core`, `gui-swing`, `jvm-common`, `texts` and `ui`, in
  one report: `build/reports/kover/html/index.html`.
- **Nothing fails on coverage**: the report is there to find what no test reaches.
- **The web page's and the app's tests are not measured**: they run in a browser and on a device,
  which [Kover](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-kover) does not reach.

### GitHub Actions runs them on Linux and Windows

[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs on every push:

- **On Ubuntu 24.04, `./gradlew check`**, the window's GL tests on Mesa's llvmpipe, as the runner
  has no GPU, and the coverage report, which is the run's artifact; then the debs and the rpms of
  `dog-vision-compose`, `dog-vision-swing`,
  `dog-vision-cli`, `dog-vision-common`, `dog-vision-web`, `dog-vision-web-sourcemap` and
  `dog-vision`, each built in two versions, the debs held to lintian's errors and warnings, and
  tried by `test_deb.sh --upgrade` in Ubuntu 20.04 and
  `test_rpm.sh --upgrade` in Fedora 42, each window under Xvfb, with `--switch` from
  `dog-vision-compose` and the source map's `dog-vision-web` to `dog-vision`, and from `dog-vision`
  to `dog-vision-cli`, and in Fedora `dog-vision-compose` installed beside `dog-vision-cli`, whose
  headless Java its launcher has to pass over; and each window's tar.gz, unpacked on the runner,
  where its command line converts a photo and its window answers `--help`.
- **On Ubuntu 24.04, `./gradlew packageAll`** as the first build of a fresh tree, apart from the
  checks: a task that reads another's output while Gradle plans the build fails only where that
  output is not built yet.
- **On Windows Server 2022, `./gradlew :gui-core:jvmTest :ffmpeg:jvmTest`**: the GL tests over
  ANGLE on WARP and over WGL on Mesa's llvmpipe, which the job installs as the system's OpenGL
  driver, as Windows's own OpenGL is 1.1, and ffmpeg's, for how a program is started on Windows.
- **On Windows Server 2022, the MSI**, built by `package_msi_on_windows.ps1` in two versions and
  tried by `test_msi_on_windows.ps1`; the MSIs are the run's artifacts.
- **On Windows Server 2022, the command line's zip**, built by `package_cli_zip_on_windows.ps1` and
  tried by `test_cli_zip_on_windows.ps1`; the zip is the run's artifact.

[`.github/workflows/msi-under-wine.yml`](../.github/workflows/msi-under-wine.yml) runs when started
by hand, as it installs Wine and makes its prefix each time: the MSI that
`package_msi_on_linux.sh` builds under Wine, in two versions, validated by `smoke.exe` and tried by
`test_msi_on_windows.ps1` on Windows Server 2022, and the command line's zip that
`package_cli_zip_on_linux.sh` builds under Wine, tried by `test_cli_zip_on_windows.ps1` there.

## Caveat: the emulator fails the video tests' colour checks

On the emulator, a BT.709 video comes out as BT.601's matrix decodes it, so a red of 200 comes out
as 186 there, and `VideoFeedTest` and `ConversionTest` fail their colour checks.

- **It goes with the decoder, as far as has been seen, not with the GPU**: the emulator decodes with
  its own `c2.goldfish.h264.decoder`, and on a Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G, Android's software decoder
  `c2.android.avc.decoder` gives the same colours on the phone's Adreno 710.
- **Qualcomm's hardware decoder gives the colours as tagged**, and the tests pass on that phone.
- **The one test that plays a video through the software decoder there checks its size only**: it
  plays a video of 96 x 64, which the hardware decoder refuses.

## Caveat: Windows is tested without a GPU and under Wine

Under Wine 11.18 on Linux, with a Windows JDK 21 and the Windows build of ffmpeg, the Compose
window was tried with a photo, a video, the camera through DirectShow, WGL chosen and WGL taken
where Direct3D 11 is switched off, and the command line.

- **Its tests and its MSI run on GitHub's Windows Server 2022**, as
  [GitHub Actions runs them](#github-actions-runs-them-on-linux-and-windows), which has no GPU:
  ANGLE draws there on Direct3D 11's software rasteriser, WARP, and WGL on Mesa's llvmpipe.
- **ANGLE's Direct3D 11 runs on Wine's translation to OpenGL** under Wine, not on a Windows driver,
  so what Wine shows is the code and ANGLE, not the drivers people have.
- **Wine's own `d3dcompiler_47` never finishes linking one of the passes' shaders**, so ANGLE hangs
  under it; Microsoft's, which `winetricks d3dcompiler_47` installs into a Wine prefix, links it.
- **ANGLE hung there shows nothing and says nothing**: neither a photo nor the camera appears,
  though the camera's light comes on, and as a hang is no failure, the window does not fall back
  to WGL.
- **Which `d3dcompiler_47` a prefix has** shows in its `system32/d3dcompiler_47.dll`, where
  `strings` finds `Wine builtin DLL` in Wine's own.
- **`--gl wgl` draws without Microsoft's `d3dcompiler_47`**, taking WGL alone, as
  [the GPU it draws on](using.md#the-gpu-it-draws-on) says, where installing it is not wanted.
- **Installing the MSI under Wine writes into the home**: Wine turns its shortcuts into the Linux
  desktop's unless `WINEDLLOVERRIDES=winemenubuilder.exe=d` is set, and the prefix's folders link
  into the home unless `winetricks sandbox` removed the links.
- **Removing the MSI under Wine leaves the files in `%ProgramData%\Dog Vision`**: msiexec's log
  shows WiX's RemoveFolderEx finding them under Wine 11.18, and they stay.
- **Under Wine, `ADDLOCAL` installs the Features it names alone**, so a part named without
  `DogVision` comes without the runtime; Windows installs a Feature's parent with it.
- **Under Wine, an upgrade installs every part**, whichever were installed before: Wine's
  `MigrateFeatureStates` migrates nothing, so only Windows shows that a later version keeps them.
- **Under Wine, the Swing window shows its menus only where Wine draws the windows' frames**: on
  Windows 10 and later FlatLaf draws a title bar of its own with the menus in it, as Windows Server
  2022 shows them, and Wine shows it only with `Decorated` set to `N` under
  `HKCU\Software\Wine\X11 Driver`, which is `winecfg`'s *Allow the window manager to decorate the
  windows* turned off.
  Where the window manager decorates them, as by default, the window has the window manager's title
  bar and no menus.
- **The Compose window's button that installs ffmpeg is tried on Linux**, with scripts in place of
  winget and PowerShell, as Wine has neither winget nor a registry that winget writes to.
  winget's install itself ran on GitHub's Windows Server 2025, whose image has winget.

## Where the test data comes from

- **[`tools/make_test_videos.sh`](../tools/make_test_videos.sh) writes the videos** in
  [`android/src/androidTest/assets`](../android/src/androidTest/assets) with ffmpeg: four flat quadrants,
  one of them turned as a phone held upright records, and one too small for Qualcomm's hardware
  decoder.
  With the same ffmpeg, it writes the same bytes each time it runs.
- **The reference values** in [`core/src/jvmTest/resources`](../core/src/jvmTest/resources) are
  those of the model of [dog-vision-python](https://github.com/loplex/dog-vision-python), which this
  project was ported from: its matrices, RNL factors and neutral points, images it renders from a
  test pattern, and the facts of every species.
  They are its output at commit
  [`306ebb9`](https://github.com/loplex/dog-vision-python/commit/306ebb9ff34b181f2419dc4dcce97e5d3517fd32),
  with numpy 2.5.3 and opencv-python-headless 5.0.0.93.
  The tests fail when `core` stops matching them.
