# Developing dog-vision

How the code is laid out, and how a change is checked.
Building the programs is [Building it](building.md)'s.

- [How the code is laid out](#how-the-code-is-laid-out) — the modules, and the GPU renderer they
  share.
- [Checking it](#checking-it) — what each Gradle task tests, the documents held to `core`, the
  Kotlin style, and what GitHub Actions runs.
- The caveats: [the emulator's colours](#caveat-the-emulator-fails-the-video-tests-colour-checks),
  [Windows without a GPU and under Wine](#caveat-windows-is-tested-without-a-gpu-and-under-wine),
  and [the libraries waiting for SDK 37](#caveat-the-libraries-wait-for-a-stable-sdk-37).
- [Where the test data comes from](#where-the-test-data-comes-from) — the test videos and the
  reference values.

## How the code is laid out

| Module                            | Holds                                      | Built for           |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| [`core`](../core)                 | the species, the model, the image pipeline | the JVM, JavaScript |
| [`gl`](../gl)                     | the GLSL ES 3.00 passes that render a view | the JVM, JavaScript |
| [`texts`](../texts)               | the wording, in English and Czech          | the JVM, JavaScript |
| [`ui`](../ui)                     | the controls, in Compose Multiplatform     | Android, the JVM    |
| [`android`](../android)           | the Android app                            | Android             |
| [`web`](../web)                   | the web page                               | JavaScript          |
| [`cli`](../cli)                   | the command line                           | the JVM             |
| [`gui-core`](../gui-core)         | what the desktop windows share             | the JVM             |
| [`gui-compose`](../gui-compose)   | the desktop window, in Compose             | the JVM             |
| [`gui-swing`](../gui-swing)       | the desktop window, in Swing               | the JVM             |
| [`testing`](../testing)           | what the renderers' tests hold them to     | the JVM, JavaScript |

[`build-logic`](../build-logic) is no module but a Gradle build of its own, included in this one:
the tasks the Linux packages are made with, which a module takes by applying the plugin
`cz.loplex.dogvision.packaging`.

- **`core` has no platform in it**: it holds what the desktop program's `dog_vision.core` holds,
  less video and the window's session.
  The one part written for each platform is how a fact's number is rounded, in
  [`Facts.jvm.kt`](../core/src/jvmMain/kotlin/cz/loplex/dogvision/core/Facts.jvm.kt) and
  [`Facts.js.kt`](../core/src/jsMain/kotlin/cz/loplex/dogvision/core/Facts.js.kt), since JavaScript
  has no `BigDecimal`.
- **`gl`'s passes run on every GPU the programs draw on**: OpenGL ES 3.0 on Android, WebGL 2 in the
  browser, and EGL, ANGLE or WGL on the desktop.
  [`ViewPasses`](../gl/src/commonMain/kotlin/cz/loplex/dogvision/gl/ViewPasses.kt) runs them
  through [`Gl`](../gl/src/commonMain/kotlin/cz/loplex/dogvision/gl/Gl.kt), the part of OpenGL ES
  3.0 they need, which each program implements.
- **`texts`' strings are in [`texts/strings`](../texts/strings)**, in Android's `strings.xml`
  format, which the build compiles into Kotlin, each named by an entry of the enum `Str` or
  `Plural`.
  The app, the web page, the window and the command line all speak through it.
- **`ui`'s Compose Multiplatform 1.11 is Jetpack Compose 1.11**, and its Material 3 1.9 is androidx
  Material 3 1.4, the versions of the app's Compose BOM, so that the app runs one of each.
- **`cli`'s `main` is the window's too**:
  [`runCommandLine`](../cli/src/jvmMain/kotlin/cz/loplex/dogvision/cli/Main.kt) answers `--help` and
  a command line it cannot read itself, converts a photo, and hands anything else to a window given
  to it.
- **`gui-core` has no toolkit in it**, neither Compose nor skiko: the GL contexts, the passes'
  renderer, ffmpeg's feeds, and the pixels read back handed to a function that makes the window's
  image of them.
  Its `LiveSession` holds what a window shows, as the Python program's does, so that the Compose
  window and the Swing one only lay it out.

### The view is rendered on the GPU, and a photo at full size on the CPU

- **The view is drawn by `gl`'s shaders**, which apply `core`'s matrix and blur, and decode and
  encode sRGB through `core`'s own lookup tables, so that they agree with it to the rounding of a
  float.
- **In the app, the same passes draw every view there is**: the screen, a recording, which the
  renderer draws into an encoder's surface as well, and a video converted at full size, through the
  Media3 effect [`ViewEffect`](../android/src/main/kotlin/cz/loplex/dogvision/video/ViewEffect.kt).
- **The desktop window renders in a GL context with no window of its own**, and reads the view back
  into the Compose window without waiting for the GPU.
- **A photo saved at full size goes through `core`'s CPU pipeline**, a strip of rows at a time,
  which has no limit on the size of a texture.

## Checking it

`./gradlew check` runs every test task below that needs no phone, Android Lint, and the Kotlin
style.
The test classes' comments say what each of them holds.

| Task                                           | Tests                                                |
|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `./gradlew :core:jvmTest`                      | the model, against the desktop program's values      |
| `./gradlew :core:allTests`                     | the same, and the JVM and Node.js agreeing           |
| `./gradlew :texts:allTests`                    | every language having every string, and plurals      |
| `./gradlew :ui:jvmTest`                        | the shared controls, in Compose's test scene         |
| `./gradlew :cli:jvmTest`                       | the options, EXIF, a conversion, the figures         |
| `./gradlew :gui-core:jvmTest`                  | the window's passes, GL contexts, ffmpeg, session    |
| `./gradlew :gui-swing:jvmTest`                 | the Swing window's image, theme and a dropped file   |
| `./gradlew :web:jsTest`                        | the page's passes, snapshot and recording            |
| `./gradlew :android:connectedDebugAndroidTest` | the renderer, recording and conversion, on a device  |
| `./gradlew :android:lintDebug`                 | Android Lint alone                                   |

- **The renderers' tests hold each GPU renderer to `core`'s CPU pipeline**: the app's, the web
  page's and the window's alike, through [`testing`](../testing)'s reference pattern.
- **`:gui-core:jvmTest` draws on this machine's GPU**, through EGL on Linux and through
  ANGLE and WGL on Windows, and runs the machine's `ffmpeg`.
- **`:web:jsTest` runs in headless Chrome, which renders WebGL 2 in software**, with SwiftShader, as
  [`karma.config.d/webgl.js`](../web/karma.config.d/webgl.js) tells it to.
  `./gradlew :web:jsTest -PwebTestsOnGpu` runs the tests on the GPU instead,
  through ANGLE on Vulkan.
- **`:android:connectedDebugAndroidTest` runs on the connected phone or emulator**, on its GPU and
  codecs.
- **`python3 tools/check_links.py` checks the Markdown**, which `check` does not: every relative
  link resolves, down to its anchor.

### The documents are checked against core

- **`ModelDocTest`, in `:core:jvmTest`, holds [The model](model.md) to `Species`**: both its tables
  list every species, in order, with the peaks, S-cone shares, acuities and sources `core` has,
  formatted as `core` formats them, and the neutral points it quotes still hold.
- **`FiguresTest`, in `:cli:jvmTest`, holds the figures in [`docs/images`](images) to what `core`
  renders**, within 2 in each channel; the captions are left out, as fonts differ between systems.
- **`./gradlew :cli:renderFigures` renders the figures again**, from the apple photo beside them;
  [`Figures.kt`](../cli/src/jvmTest/kotlin/cz/loplex/dogvision/cli/Figures.kt) says what each
  shows.

### The Kotlin style is ktlint's

The style is [ktlint](https://pinterest.github.io/ktlint/)'s, as IntelliJ IDEA formats Kotlin, set
in [`.editorconfig`](../.editorconfig):

- `./gradlew ktlintCheck` checks it, and `./gradlew ktlintFormat` fixes what it can;
  `build-logic`'s own are `:build-logic:ktlintCheck` and `:build-logic:ktlintFormat`, and each
  module's `check` runs `build-logic`'s;
- `./gradlew checkLineLength` holds every line to 120 characters, comments included: ktlint does not
  measure a line that is a comment and nothing else.

### GitHub Actions runs them on Linux and Windows

[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs on every push:

- **On Ubuntu 24.04, `./gradlew check`**, the window's GL tests on Mesa's llvmpipe, as the runner
  has no GPU; then the debs and the rpms of `dog-vision`, `dog-vision-swing` and `dog-vision-cli`,
  each built in two versions and tried by `test_deb.sh --upgrade` in Ubuntu 20.04 and
  `test_rpm.sh --upgrade` in Fedora 42, each window under Xvfb; and each window's tar.gz, unpacked
  on the runner, where its command line runs and its window's main converts a photo.
- **On Windows Server 2022, `./gradlew :gui-core:jvmTest`**, over ANGLE on WARP and over WGL on
  Mesa's llvmpipe, which the job puts beside `java.exe`, as Windows's own OpenGL is 1.1.
- **On Windows Server 2022, each window's MSI**, built by `package_msi_on_windows.ps1` in two
  versions and tried by `test_msi_on_windows.ps1`; the MSIs are the run's artifacts.

[`.github/workflows/msi-under-wine.yml`](../.github/workflows/msi-under-wine.yml) runs when started
by hand, as it installs Wine and .NET Framework 4.8 each time: each window's MSI that
`package_msi_on_linux.sh` builds under Wine, validated by `smoke.exe` and tried by
`test_msi_on_windows.ps1` on Windows Server 2022.

## Caveat: the emulator fails the video tests' colour checks

On the emulator, a BT.709 video comes out as BT.601's matrix decodes it, so a red of 200 comes out
as 186 there, and `VideoFeedTest` and `ConversionTest` fail their colour checks.

- **It goes with the decoder, as far as has been seen, not with the GPU**: the emulator decodes with
  its own `c2.goldfish.h264.decoder`, and on a Redmi Note 13 Pro 5G, Android's software decoder
  `c2.android.avc.decoder` gives the same colours on the phone's Adreno 710.
- **Qualcomm's hardware decoder gives the colours as tagged**, and the tests pass on that phone.
- **The one test that plays a video through the software decoder there checks its size only**: it
  plays a video of 96 x 64, which the hardware decoder refuses.

## Caveat: Windows is tested without a GPU and under Wine

Under Wine 11.18 on Linux, with a Windows JDK 21 and the Windows build of ffmpeg, the Compose
window was tried with a photo, a video, the camera through DirectShow, WGL chosen and WGL taken
where Direct3D 11 is switched off, and the command line.

- **Its tests and its MSI run on GitHub's Windows Server 2022**, as
  [GitHub Actions runs them](#github-actions-runs-them-on-linux-and-windows), which has no GPU:
  ANGLE draws there on Direct3D 11's software rasteriser, WARP, and WGL on Mesa's llvmpipe.
- **ANGLE's Direct3D 11 runs on Wine's translation to OpenGL** under Wine, not on a Windows driver,
  so what Wine shows is the code and ANGLE, not the drivers people have.
- **Wine's own `d3dcompiler_47` never finishes linking one of the passes' shaders**, so ANGLE hangs
  under it; Microsoft's, which `winetricks d3dcompiler_47` installs into a Wine prefix, links it.
- **Installing the MSI under Wine writes into the home**: Wine turns its shortcuts into the Linux
  desktop's unless `WINEDLLOVERRIDES=winemenubuilder.exe=d` is set, and the prefix's folders link
  into the home unless `winetricks sandbox` removed the links.
- **The Compose window's button that installs ffmpeg is tried on Linux**, with scripts in place of
  winget and PowerShell, as Wine has neither winget nor a registry that winget writes to.
  winget's install itself ran on GitHub's Windows Server 2025, whose image has winget.

## Caveat: the libraries wait for a stable SDK 37

The Compose BOM stays at 2026.06.01, `androidx.core` at 1.18 and `lifecycle` at 2.10, and the app
targets API 36: the releases after them need `compileSdk` 37, which has no stable SDK platform yet.
Android Lint says so in its warnings, beside one that AGP is not the newest, which stays at 9.1.1
for IntelliJ IDEA's Android plugin.

## Where the test data comes from

- **[`tools/make_test_videos.sh`](../tools/make_test_videos.sh) writes the videos** in
  [`android/src/androidTest/assets`](../android/src/androidTest/assets) with ffmpeg: four flat quadrants,
  one of them turned as a phone held upright records, and one too small for Qualcomm's hardware
  decoder.
  With the same ffmpeg, it writes the same bytes each time it runs.
- **[`tools/reference_values.py`](../tools/reference_values.py) writes the reference values** in
  [`core/src/jvmTest/resources`](../core/src/jvmTest/resources) from a checkout of the desktop
  program: its matrices, RNL factors and neutral points, images it renders from a test pattern, and
  the facts of every species.
  Its docstring says how to run it; the tests fail when `core` stops matching them.
