# The licences of what the packages bundle

The texts the packages carry beside the project's own licence, each word for word from its source.
[`ThirdParty.kt`](../../build-logic/src/main/kotlin/cz/loplex/dogvision/packaging/licenses/ThirdParty.kt)
says which part of which package each is the licence of.

A text is fetched again when its library changes version: skiko's Skia, LWJGL, ANGLE, webpack.
The versions are those the build bundled when the text was taken.

Skia's libraries are those of its DEPS at skiko's Skia, and which of them a native holds was
measured in the native: the Linux one has FreeType, the DNG SDK and piex, the Windows one
SPIRV-Cross and D3D12MemoryAllocator, which Skia's Direct3D needs.
piex, Wuffs, SPIRV-Cross and Abseil, the last in ANGLE, are under Apache-2.0 and take its text.
