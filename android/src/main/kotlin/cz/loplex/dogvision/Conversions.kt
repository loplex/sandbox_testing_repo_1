/**
 * The one conversion of a photo or a video at its full size there is, run by [ConversionService] rather than in the
 * screen's ViewModel, whose scope Android ends with the screen: it goes on while the app is in the background, or
 * swiped away from the recent apps, and its notification shows how far it has got and cancels it.
 *
 * It is [running] from [start] until its work returns, fails or is cancelled. [message] is what it is at, "Converting:
 * 42 %", then the message its work returns; null once it is cancelled. [sdrOfferedWith] is that last message where it
 * says a video's HDR could not be tone-mapped, which the screen then offers to convert as SDR.
