# How the braid is built

git-timebraid recreates every commit the selected refs reach, from every input repository, in one
output repository, each input under its own subdirectory, or one of them at the root, and adds
artificial parent edges that chain commits *across* repositories in chronological order. The
resulting first-parent chain is called **the braid**.

This document is the specification of that construction: which parents each commit ends up with,
which tree, what happens to branches, and where the "state of the world at that moment" guarantee
stops holding.

- What the tool is for, and why the braid is shaped this way: the [README](../README.md).
- What to type, and what the output holds: [usage.md](usage.md).

Vocabulary used throughout:

- **input repository** — one of the repositories being merged; contributes one subdirectory to the
  output, at a path that may be nested, which is its destination; or, for the one `--root-repo`
  input, the output root, whose entries it shares with the other inputs' destinations. With
  `--splice` a destination may lie inside another input's, whose directory then holds both, and
  with `--dissolve-submodules` it may land on a gitlink the containing repository keeps there,
  replacing it
- **mainline** — the branch treated as each input's main line of development (`--mainline-branch`)
- **ordering timestamp** — the timestamp the interleaving compares: the committer date, or the
  author date with `--order-by author`. It is settled once when the input is read.

---

## The parent rule

How the sequence is built:

- The braid is built from the **first-parent chain** of each input repository's mainline branch.
- Those chains are merged into one sequence by always taking whichever chain's next commit is oldest
  — a k-way merge, the same idea as merging sorted lists.
- A chain's own order never changes regardless of what its timestamps say, so ancestry on the
  mainline holds by construction; across repositories, the earlier ordering timestamp comes first.

How parents are rewritten. For every commit `c`, writing `pred` for the commit preceding it in that
sequence:

```text
c is not on the braid          →  parents'(c) = parents(c)             unchanged
pred is already a parent of c  →  parents'(c) = parents(c)             unchanged
otherwise                      →  parents'(c) = [pred] + parents(c)    braided edge prepended
```

That is the whole rule. Note what it does **not** do:

- It never removes a parent — every original edge stays exactly where it was.
- The braided edge is *prepended*, so it becomes the first parent. That is what makes
  `git log --first-parent` walk the braid.

The arithmetic follows:

| commit in its original repo | predecessor on the braid            | parents in the braid                         |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| root commit                 | none, as the braid's first commit   | **0** — unchanged                            |
| root commit                 | a different repo                    | **1** — the braided edge alone               |
| ordinary commit             | same repo (i.e. already its parent) | **1** — unchanged                            |
| ordinary commit             | a different repo                    | **2** — braided edge + original parent       |
| merge commit                | a different repo                    | **3** — braided edge + both original parents |

[Example 01](examples/01-two-linear-repos/README.md) is the rule on two linear repositories, and
[example 04](examples/04-clock-skew-in-repo/README.md) on a child timestamped before its own parent,
which its chain still keeps after that parent.

### Why three parents

The three-parent case is not a curiosity, it is the price of the guarantee. Suppose `webui` merged a
feature branch, and the commit immediately preceding that merge in time came from `backend`:

```text
original:   parents(b3)  = [b2, f1]           b3 merges the feature branch f1 into b2
braid:      parents'(b3) = [a4, b2, f1]
                            │   └── b2 and f1: every original edge, untouched
                            └─────── a4: the braided edge, i.e. the commit
                                    preceding b3 in time
```

Drop `b2` here and you would have a tidier graph and a false history: `git merge-base`,
`git log --first-parent webui-side`, and every "when did this diverge" question would start lying.
So it keeps all three.

---

## The tree rule

A commit's tree in the braid is derived from its first parent:

> **tree'(c)** = the tree of `parents'(c)[0]`, with the entry at `c`'s own destination replaced by
> `c`'s original tree.

For the very first commit on the braid there is no parent, so its tree is built from that commit
alone, at its destination.

The input at the root (`--root-repo`) has the output root as its destination: its top-level entries
stand in the root tree beside the other inputs' destinations, or around one that reaches into its
directories, and its commits replace those entries.

Because the first parent is the time predecessor, the map of *subdirectory → content* accumulates as
you walk forward:

- Each subdirectory holds whatever its repository last committed at or before this point.
- A repository that did not exist yet simply is not there.

This is the mechanism behind the whole promise: "the state of every repository at that moment" is
not computed on demand, it is simply what the commit's tree contains.

A subdirectory entry *is* the input's own root tree object, so nothing is recursed into and no blob
is copied: the output shares its content with the inputs. Where every destination is a single name,
that makes a braided commit cost exactly one small tree — its own root.

### Nested destinations

A destination may be a path rather than a single name (`repo.git::libs/backend`). An entry name
cannot hold a `/`, so the segments above the last one are trees the braid builds itself, and inputs
sharing a prefix share the tree for it:

| Input                       | Lands at        | Prefix trees the braid builds |
|-----------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| `webui.git::apps/webui`     | `apps/webui/`   | `apps/`                       |
| `backend.git::libs/backend` | `libs/backend/` | `libs/`                       |
| `codegen.git::libs/codegen` | `libs/codegen/` | `libs/`                       |

`libs/` is one tree holding both entries, not one per input.

What follows from that is the whole of the rule:

- A commit costs its root tree plus one tree per *changed* prefix, and no more than that: an
  untouched prefix keeps the tree object the previous commit used, which is what content addressing
  gives for free.
- **No destination may contain another, unless `--splice` says so.** The entry written at a
  destination is the input's own tree object, and there is no room beside it, so `libs` and
  `libs/backend` cannot both hold a repository the cheap way. The planner refuses the pair by
  default.
- **`--splice` opens the containing repository's tree instead.** Its content at `libs/` is read into
  entries and the input placed inside it goes in beside them, so the directory ends up holding both.
  This is the one place the braid descends into an input's tree, and it descends only along the
  prefixes some destination names.
- **The repository at the output root is spliced without the flag.** Every destination lies inside
  it, which is what `--root-repo` asked for; the flag exists for the containments that are implicit
  in the paths, where a typo and an intention look alike.
- **A splice is not a merge of two repositories' files.** What the containing repository already
  holds at the inner destination is a collision, and so is a prefix segment that is not a directory
  there. Both depend on the tree at that commit, which the planner has never seen, so both are
  answered ahead of the write pass instead — one walk over the plan, examining each containing
  repository's tree once per *distinct* tree rather than once per commit — and named against the
  commit they happen at.
- **`--dissolve-submodules` excepts one entry: a gitlink at the destination itself.** There the
  containing repository was already saying another repository belongs at that exact path, so the
  input landing there replaces the gitlink instead of colliding with it. See
  [dissolving a submodule](#dissolving-a-submodule) below, which is where the `.gitmodules` side of
  it is worked out.

[Example 05](examples/05-nested-layout/README.md) is the plain case on three repositories, with the
reused prefix trees shown by sha; [example 06](examples/06-splice/README.md) is the splice, together
with the pair refused without the flag and the collision the flag does not excuse.

### The one exception: `.gitmodules`

`.gitmodules` is the only file whose *location* is part of its meaning — git reads it from the
repository root and nowhere else. Carried along inside a subdirectory it would become text nothing
reads, describing paths that no longer say where the gitlink it names actually sits. So it is the
one file the braid writes for itself:

> **`.gitmodules`** at the root of `tree'(c)` = the `[submodule]` sections of every input that has
> content at `c`, with each section's `path` — and its name — prefixed by that input's destination.

The gitlink entries need no help; they ride along in their input's tree like any other entry, and
the commit a gitlink names is fetched from the submodule's own url rather than from this repository.

An input placed at `backend/`, holding `a.txt` and a submodule at `vendor/lib`, and the only input
with content yet, gives a tree holding:

| Entry                 | Kind              | Where it came from                     |
|-----------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `.gitmodules`         | blob              | written by the braid                   |
| `backend/.gitmodules` | blob              | the input's — carried along, now inert |
| `backend/a.txt`       | blob              | the input's                            |
| `backend/vendor/lib`  | gitlink, `160000` | the input's, untouched                 |

and the `.gitmodules` the braid writes for itself reads:

```ini
[submodule "backend/vendor/lib"]
	path = backend/vendor/lib
	url = https://example.com/lib.git
```

Two consequences worth knowing:

- The input's own `<subdir>/.gitmodules` stays where the tree rule put it. Rewriting it would mean
  recursing into that subtree and copying it, which is the cost the tree rule exists to avoid — and
  git ignores a `.gitmodules` outside the root anyway, so it is inert rather than wrong.
- A **relative** `url` (`../lib.git`) resolves against the superproject's own remote. The output's
  remote is not the input's, so a relative url points somewhere else after the merge. Making those
  absolute in the inputs, before merging, is the fix.

### Dissolving a submodule

A superproject and the repository its `vendor/lib` gitlink points at are two inputs of the same
merge often enough to be worth naming. Placed at `vendor/lib`, the second one lands exactly where
the first keeps its gitlink, which is a collision, since [a splice is not a
merge](#nested-destinations) of two repositories' files — the tool cannot tell from the paths
whether that is the point or an accident.

`--dissolve-submodules` says it is the point, and two things follow:

> At a commit where an input's content occupies a path, the **gitlink** there gives way to that
> input's tree, and any `[submodule]` section whose `path` is that path is left out of the root
> `.gitmodules`.

Without the flag there is nothing to list: the pair is refused before anything is written into the
output, and [example 07](examples/07-dissolve-submodule/README.md) shows the message it is refused
with. With the flag, the superproject at the root and the library at `vendor/lib` give:

| Entry                   | Where it came from                          |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `a.txt`                 | the superproject's own content              |
| `vendor/lib/src/lib.kt` | the library's own tree, and its own commits |

The section has to go with the gitlink because the two describe each other: a `path` naming a
directory git finds no gitlink at is a mapping `git submodule` reports as broken. When that was the
only section, no root `.gitmodules` is written at all — and the root repository's own copy is taken
out of the tree with it, since leaving it would publish the input's text describing a submodule the
output no longer has. A container placed below the root keeps its own copy, carried along and inert
like any input's `<subdir>/.gitmodules`.

Both halves are decided per commit rather than per run, for the same reason every other tree
question is: an input that has no content yet occupies nothing, and the gitlink standing in for it
is still the truth at that point of the braid.

What the flag is **not** is a faithful expansion of the submodule. A gitlink names one commit of the
submodule — the one the superproject pinned — and what takes its place is whatever that input had
reached at that point of the braid, which the interleave decides. The output's `vendor/lib`
therefore moves with the braid, not with the pin. That is the reason it is opt-in rather than
inferred from the paths, and the reason a gitlink at a segment *above* a destination stays an error:
nothing is placed at that path, so there is no content that could stand in for the submodule.

[Example 07](examples/07-dissolve-submodule/README.md) carries this out on a superproject with two
submodules — one dissolved, one left alone — and lists the output's trees at four points of the
braid, including ones from before either gitlink existed, with the root `.gitmodules` quoted at the
tip.

## Branches

Branches need no special handling, which is worth explaining because it looks like they should.

- Only commits on the braid get reparented.
- Everything else keeps its original parents, and branches are just refs pointing at the recreated
  commits.
- So a side branch forks off wherever its base commit landed — and if that base is on the braid, it
  already carries the accumulated content of every repository.

The consequence is that a branch which exists in **one** input repository still gives you a working
checkout of the whole system. Checking out `webui/esbuild-experiment`, a branch that only ever
existed in `webui`:

| Directory              | Holds                                      |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `codegen/`, `backend/` | whatever they were when the branch was cut |
| `webui/`               | whatever the branch itself reached         |

Which is exactly what you want, and it costs no configuration.

[Example 03](examples/03-long-lived-side-branch/README.md) shows a side branch that spans nearly the
whole of its repository's history: the other repository's commits interleave throughout, since only
the mainline chains make up the braid.

### Which refs are carried over

Which refs a run carries over is not only a question about the output's refs: it decides which
commits are read at all. Each input is read from the refs that were selected, so a ref left out
contributes no commits, and the side branch it pointed at is absent from the graph rather than
merely unnamed.

- The selection is a glob over **full** ref names — `refs/heads/*`, `refs/tags/v1.*` — and applies
  to branches and tags alike (`--ref`, repeatable). A short name cannot say whether `v1.0` is a
  branch or a tag, so the patterns are matched against the full name and a `*` spans path
  separators.
- No selection means **every branch and tag**. `-b`/`--branch` is shorthand for one pattern,
  `--ref refs/heads/<name>`; since a branch name cannot contain a `*`, the short form desugars
  exactly — and it therefore selects that branch *and no tags*.
- The resolved mainline is loaded whatever the patterns say, because the braid is built along it.
- Every ref is recreated under a prefix, `{repo}/` by default — `--tag-prefix` for a tag,
  `--branch-prefix` for a branch — so two inputs that both hold `v1.0` do not collide, unless they
  share a name, where a prefix holding `{subdir}` is what keeps them apart. It applies
  wherever a pattern has not spelled its destination out, which is what makes an output ref name
  follow from the input it came from and from nothing else the run did; emptying it asks for the
  plain names, and two inputs meeting there is refused rather than resolved.

`--interleave-ref` uses the same matcher and reads its empty case the other way round: no selection
is every branch and tag, no interleave pattern is none of them. It is also matched against what the
selection already admitted, so widening the interleave cannot widen what is read.

That last clause is also why there is a third flag. One selection answers three questions, and they
do not carry the same risk:

| Question                                              | Decided by                                                | What changes when it changes        |
|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| What is read into the graph                           | `--ref`, and the mainline whatever it says                | how many commits the output holds   |
| What may move the braid                               | `--interleave-ref`, matched against what `--ref` admitted | the braid's commits, and their shas |
| What gets a ref in the output, and in which namespace | `--ref` and `--label-ref`, with their destination         | nothing but the ref names           |

Naming is free, and a caller should be able to ask for it generously. Weighing is a scheduling
decision, and should be deliberate and small. Because `--interleave-ref` can only match what `--ref`
admitted, a ref named purely to have it in the output can reach the second row — and the refs
cheapest to name are the likeliest to do it. One pointing into the mainline's own history adds no
commits at all, and its ancestry is exactly the merged-in history whose arrival into scope makes
merges wait.

`--label-ref` is that third row on its own. It recreates a matched ref whose target the graph
already holds, never extends what is read, and never becomes an interleave tip. The safety is then
something that can be stated and tested, rather than a coincidence of two globs missing each other:
**adding any `--label-ref` to a run cannot change a single commit the run writes.**

Git draws the same distinction with a two-sided refspec — `+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*`,
where the left half says what is fetched and the right half what it is called. `--label-ref` is how
the right half is asked for alone, and a pattern's destination *is* that right half:
`--ref 'legacy::refs/heads/*:refs/tags/'` reads `legacy`'s branches and writes them as tags, which
is how a dead branch is kept for the record without keeping it as a branch or dropping the commits
only it reaches.

The prefix rules above are the default naming, and a destination overrides exactly the part of the
name it spells out — nothing, the namespace, or the whole of it. A destination holding a `*` takes
the last of those: the star is substituted with what the pattern's own star matched, so
`refs/changes/*:refs/changes/{repo}/*` keeps a namespace this program has no rule for and qualifies
it, and no prefix goes near the result. That is also why a pattern reading such a namespace must
carry a destination: there would otherwise be nothing to name the result with.

[Example 09](examples/09-ref-selection/README.md) runs five selections over one pair of repositories
and lists what each output holds — including the commit that disappears entirely under `-b main`,
and comes back when the tags are asked for.

## Caveats

Two things limit how literally "the state of the world at this moment" can be read.

### "That instant" is the mainline, not the deployment

- It means *the mainline branches at that instant*, as dated by the ordering timestamp — not what
  was deployed.
- If work is authored long before it is merged, author dates and integration order diverge.
- `--order-by committer` is usually the better choice for "what did the system look like" questions,
  `--order-by author` for "what was being written".

### A merge can carry a repository's future, and pass it on

This one is sharper:

- A merge commit's tree already reflects everything it merged in, including a branch whose last
  commit is timestamped *after* the merge itself.
- Nothing about braiding changes that tree, and every later commit inherits it forward — the
  ordinary accumulation rule, not a choice this tool makes — so those commits show that same
  "future" content too.
- This is a fact about the input history — a merge dated before the branch it takes in — not
  something any interleaving of the braid can undo.

The braid itself adds nothing to this. Every braid edge — the artificial one this tool inserts —
runs from a commit back to one **no younger than itself**:

- A braid predecessor from another repository won a direct comparison of timestamps against it.
- A predecessor from the commit's *own* repository is already its first parent, so no edge is added
  there at all.

So suppose `backend`'s `m` merges in a long-lived feature branch whose last commit is timestamped
after `m` itself. As long as the mainlines run forward in time up to `m`, checking out `m` shows
`webui/` as of a moment at or before `m`'s own — the braid places nothing later beside it. What you
see from the future is only what `m`'s own tree already carried, and what any later commit inherits
from it.

"The state of the world at this moment" is exact precisely when every commit's timestamp is
consistent with all of its parents', not only its first one.

### Trading the guarantee away on purpose

Every braid edge running back to a commit no younger than the one it leaves is the default's
guarantee, and `--interleave-ref` is how you give it up deliberately:

- Name a ref and its commits may delay a mainline merge that merges them in.
- The merge then lands by *their* time rather than by its own — arguably the more honest position
  for a merge whose content reaches later than its own date, and which does let the merge acquire a
  braid predecessor younger than itself.
- Off by default, because a branch nobody considers significant should not get to move where two
  other repositories meet.

A plain pattern can only add, so a `^` in front of one takes refs back out of what the rest matched
— the same mark git puts on a negative refspec. The subtraction is over ref names and happens before
any commit is reached, so a commit two refs name is opted in by whichever of them survives rather
than by neither.

The pairing that matters is `--interleave-ref 'refs/heads/* ^refs/heads/main'`. Since the scope is
the ancestry of every opted-in tip, and a mainline tip's ancestry is everything that mainline ever
merged, opting the mainlines in is nearly the whole graph; subtracting the mainline refs from the
branches is what leaves *every side branch* as the scope. A bare star opts in every tag besides, and
a tag on a mainline reaches what that mainline had merged by then.

Here a subtraction needs something to subtract from: this option's empty case is *no ref*, so a
value holding nothing but subtractions is refused rather than resolving to nothing. `--ref` reads
its empty case the other way, and `^` alone there means *every branch and tag except* — see
[taking refs back out](usage.md#taking-refs-back-out).

What it cannot do is take a commit out of scope that something else opted in reaches — and that is a
property of the history rather than of this implementation. A branch merged into a mainline is that
mainline's ancestry, so *in scope, except the commits of this merged branch* describes no graph.

[Example 02](examples/02-merge-with-late-branch/README.md) is this whole argument on a six-commit
history you can build and inspect: two inputs, braided both ways, with the merge landing before the
other repository's last commit by default and after it once every ref is opted in.
