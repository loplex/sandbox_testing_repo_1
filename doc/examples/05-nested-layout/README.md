# 05 — nested destinations, and a shared prefix

The baseline of the layout axis: three repositories placed at paths rather than at plain names, two
of them sharing `libs/`. Shows what the output tree looks like, and that a prefix no commit touched
costs nothing.

## Input

```text
backend: a1@10 <- a2@30      src/Main.kt, then src/Db.kt
codegen: c1@20               gen.py
webui:   b1@25 <- b2@40      index.html, then style.css
```

Built by `build-inputs.sh`; each has a single `main` branch and no merges. The graphs are dull on
purpose — the trees are what this example is about.

## Command

```bash
./git-timebraid -o doc/examples/05-nested-layout/output --no-bare \
    --plan-out doc/examples/05-nested-layout/plan.txt \
    doc/examples/05-nested-layout/input/backend::libs/backend \
    doc/examples/05-nested-layout/input/codegen::libs/codegen \
    doc/examples/05-nested-layout/input/webui::apps/webui
```

The suffix gives the destination, and each name follows its last segment — `backend`, `codegen`,
`webui`. Here that is also what the directories were called, so nothing was renamed by placing them.

That name is what the commit subjects below distinguish the repositories by, and it is deliberately
*not* the destination: `--subject-prefix` defaults to `{repo}: `, which is why they read `backend: `
and not `libs/backend: `. A destination can be arbitrarily deep; a name defaults to one segment.

## Result

```console
$ git -C output log --first-parent main --date=iso --pretty="format:%h %ad %s"
cb225d5 2023-11-16 14:13:20 +0000 webui: b2
e31b059 2023-11-16 04:13:20 +0000 backend: a2
13bccc6 2023-11-15 23:13:20 +0000 webui: b1
b9dc21a 2023-11-15 18:13:20 +0000 codegen: c1
7dda512 2023-11-15 08:13:20 +0000 backend: a1

$ git -C output ls-tree -r --name-only HEAD
apps/webui/index.html
apps/webui/style.css
libs/backend/src/Db.kt
libs/backend/src/Main.kt
libs/codegen/gen.py
```

`a1(10), c1(20), b1(25), a2(30), b2(40)` — the ordinary interleave, unaffected by the destinations.
`libs/` and `apps/` exist in no input; they are trees the braid builds because an entry name cannot
hold a `/`, and `backend` and `codegen` share the one for `libs`.

### A prefix nobody touched keeps its tree object

The tip commit is `webui`'s, so nothing under `libs/` changed at it — and the `libs` tree it points
at is not a new object but the previous commit's, byte for byte:

```console
$ git -C output rev-parse HEAD:libs HEAD~1:libs
5b445c2066a6ad21e434f8074f629d3bcd3095c1
5b445c2066a6ad21e434f8074f629d3bcd3095c1

$ git -C output rev-parse HEAD^{tree} HEAD~1^{tree}
3d894292baaa69d6b465f0ce1fc60dfdd4858123
38f396f33ef5537384d95e95f707b7542b6dfd50
```

The root trees differ, as they must — `apps/` moved. Everything below an untouched prefix is reused,
so a commit costs its root tree plus one new tree per *changed* prefix, and no more. `wrote 5
commits and 10 trees on top` in the run's report is exactly that: 5 root trees, plus one prefix tree
per commit — `libs` for the three `backend`/`codegen` commits, `apps` for the two `webui` ones. The
`libs/backend` and `apps/webui` entries themselves are never written at all; they are the inputs'
own tree objects, which the fetch already put in the output.

### A repository that did not exist yet occupies nothing

```console
$ git -C output ls-tree -r --name-only HEAD~4
libs/backend/src/Main.kt
```

At the first commit of the braid neither `libs/codegen` nor `apps/webui` is present — not empty,
absent. `plan.txt` says the same thing in the planner's own terms; its `content=[...]` column names
only the repositories that have content at that point.

Try it yourself: `git -C doc/examples/05-nested-layout/output log --stat --first-parent` from the
repo root.
