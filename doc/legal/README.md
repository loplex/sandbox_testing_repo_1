# Third-party licenses

Every archive carries the program's dependencies in `lib/`, each as the unmodified jar its project
publishes, beside `lib/git-timebraid.jar`.\
Each is listed below under the license it is used under, and the full text of every one of those
licenses is in this directory.\
A jar that ships license files of its own still carries them.

`check-legal.py` holds the list to the build's runtime dependencies, both ways: a dependency added
without a row here, or a row left behind by one removed, fails CI.

## The bundled runtime

The archives whose name carries an operating system and an architecture also hold a trimmed OpenJDK
build under `runtime/`, licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 2, with the
OpenJDK Assembly Exception.\
Its own license files travel with it, under `runtime/legal/`, one directory per module.
