/**
 * The page's rendering of a photo or of a video's or a camera's frames: gl's [ViewPasses], as the Android app runs
 * them, over WebGL 2. The passes compile when this is made, and throw IllegalStateException if the GPU's driver cannot
 * compile or link one.
 *
 * A photo comes upright, as the browser decodes it, and is turned upright once all the same, as the app turns every
 * frame. It does not change while it is shown, so the share of pixels its map of differences marks is counted at once.
 * A camera's or a video's frame comes upright too, the browser having turned it as the display is or as the video's
 * rotation says, unless [upload] finds the browser cannot, and is mirrored if need be; its share is counted without
 * waiting for the GPU, and handed over a frame or two later, as in the app.
