 *
 * WebGL draws into its own canvas only, so the images are rendered a second time, by passes of their own in a WebGL 2
 * context of their own, from the same frames, and a MediaRecorder records that canvas, which the page never shows.
 * Reading the images back from the page's context instead costs the main thread a copy of every image each frame,
 * which slows the page itself on a phone. The canvas is drawn again on every frame of the page, so that a still photo
 * is recorded at the recording's rate too.
