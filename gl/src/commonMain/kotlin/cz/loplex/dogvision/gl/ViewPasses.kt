/**
 * The GL passes that render a view's images from a frame, through [gl], in whichever context draws them: the Android
 * app's screen, a video being converted, or the web page's canvas. Everything here runs on that context's thread,
 * between [create] and [release].
 *
 * The frame is turned upright into a texture of its own, each image of the view is rendered into a texture of its own,
 * the size the upright frame has, and [draw] puts the images into boxes of the framebuffer bound. Rendering the map of
 * differences into a texture of its own keeps it from reading the texture it draws into, which GL leaves undefined.
 *
 * The passes bind a vertex array of their own while they draw and unbind it after, so that a context they share with
 * code drawing from client-side vertex arrays, as Media3's does, is left as it was.
