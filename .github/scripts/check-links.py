"""Check what the documentation claims about itself: that every link it makes resolves.

The docs link into each other: README.md, CHANGELOG.md and everything under doc/, the worked
examples included. A section renamed in one of them leaves a link in another pointing at an anchor
that no longer exists, and the rendered page gives no sign of it -- the link simply lands at the
top of the file. `mvn verify` cannot see this and neither can check-examples.py, which compares
quoted command output rather than prose.

Three things are checked:

  * every relative link resolves -- the file exists, and when the link names an anchor, that file
    has a heading which produces it;
  * no link points at a heading whose anchor is not predictable (see `anchors`);
  * every pointer at a document from a Kotlin comment resolves the same way. A comment saying
    `see doc/how-it-works.md#the-parent-rule` makes exactly the claim a link makes, and rots for
    exactly the same reason, but it is not in a document so nothing above would look at it. Only
    comments are read, never code -- cut out by kotlin_source.py's scanner, because a regex over
    `//` cannot tell a comment from the `//` in a URL literal, and a string holding `// doc/x.md`
    would then be reported as a broken pointer. Sources other than Kotlin are a gap rather than a
    decision.

The second is deliberately about the link rather than the heading. Most headings here are titles
nothing anchors to -- `# 01 — two linear repositories`, `# 04 — a child commit timestamped before
its own parent` -- and their dashes are the doc set's voice, not a defect. A dash only costs
anything once something tries to link past it, so that is where the check bites; the rest are
listed as a note.

The width of a code block is check-blocks.py's rule next door, not this one's: it is about how a
block is shown rather than about what a document points at, and one checker over both would go red
without saying which of the two had failed.

External links are left alone on purpose: they fail for reasons that have nothing to do with the
commit under test, and a check that goes red on someone else's outage stops being read.
