"""Hold doc/legal/README.md's list of libraries to the build's runtime dependencies.

Every archive ships each runtime dependency as its own jar in lib/, and doc/legal/README.md says
under which license each one is used. Nothing else connects the two: a dependency added to the pom
lands in lib/ and in every release without a row, and a row outlives the dependency it was written
for, while the build, the tests and the archives all stay green.

So the list is read from the table's first column, one `group:artifact` per row, and asked of the
resolver both ways: every runtime dependency has a row, and every row is a runtime dependency. The
resolver rather than the jars in target/lib/, because a jar carries its coordinates only when Maven
built it (`META-INF/maven/.../pom.properties`), and most of these were built by something else.

That a row's license links a text which exists is check-links.py's question, asked of every
document; what the license of a library is, nothing here can know.

Usage:
  check-legal.py          compare doc/legal/README.md with `mvn dependency:list`
