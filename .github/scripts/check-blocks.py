"""Hold every code block in the documentation to the width it can be shown at.

This is a rule about blocks and not about prose. A paragraph wraps to whatever width the reader
has; a code block, fenced or indented, scrolls instead, so one long line puts a horizontal
scrollbar under everything around it and hides the end of the line from anyone who does not drag
it.

Quoted output is the case where that cannot always be fixed: shortening a message the program
really prints would make the documentation untrue. A block that has to stay wide therefore says so,
on the line above it:

    <!-- wide block: why this one cannot be shortened -->

which is a claim with a cost, not an off switch. A marker covering no overlong line fails as loudly
as an overlong line does, so no block keeps its exemption after the line that earned it is gone.

**It is its own script because width has nothing to do with links.** A link that goes nowhere and
a block too wide to read fail for unrelated reasons, so one checker over both would have to name
the union in its step to stay true, and would go red under a name that did not say which rule it
was. Nor does it share check-links.py's parsing, which skips fenced blocks only. What it shares is
with check-width.py, which measures the prose outside a block: both take the blocks from
markdown_source.py, so no line but a fence or a table row falls to neither.
