"""Take the section CHANGELOG.md holds for one tag, ready to be the body of that release.

A release body and a changelog entry answer the same question, and the release page is where it gets
asked: someone arriving at v0.2.0 wants to know what changed in 0.2.0. Linking the changelog on
`main` instead shows them whatever is newest, which after the next release is somebody else's entry.

So the entry is not written twice. It is written once, in CHANGELOG.md, and this lifts the section
for the tag being released.

Three things are refused rather than guessed at, because each would ship silently:

  * no section for the version, which means the release would go out with install instructions and
    no account of what changed. The open entry is headed `## [Unreleased]` while the work is in
    progress, as Keep a Changelog has it, and names no version: the version being worked towards is
    the pom's. Giving that heading its version and date is a hand's job before the tag is cut --
    the release runs on a throwaway checkout and has nowhere to commit the change to -- so this is
    what makes forgetting it loud, and the refusal names the entry to rename;
  * a heading whose date field is not a `YYYY-MM-DD` date. Anything but a date in that field is
    refused rather than read as one;
  * a version with no link definition at the foot of the file, where its heading's `[0.2.0]` would
    otherwise render as the brackets themselves.

Relative links are rewritten against the tag. A link in CHANGELOG.md has to be relative, since that
is what resolves in the repository and what check-links.py verifies; a link in a release body has to
be absolute, since that page is not inside the tree. Pinning at the tag rather than at a branch also
means the target says what it said on the day, which is the same reason the entry is lifted at all.
