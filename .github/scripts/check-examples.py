"""Replays doc/examples and checks that it still says the truth.

The examples are the one place the tool's output is quoted to a reader verbatim, as something they
can reproduce on their own machine. `mvn verify` never goes near them: it proves the behaviour, not
the accuracy of what the READMEs claim that behaviour looks like. Those are different claims, and
only the first one had a check.

So the READMEs are the source of truth here, and this script executes what they say and compares it
against what they show. Nothing is duplicated into the script -- adding an example, or changing a
command, needs no edit here.

Three block conventions in an example's README, and nothing else is looked at:

  ```bash
  ./git-timebraid ...                         an invocation that must succeed. Continuation lines
  ```                                         end with a backslash, as in the READMEs.

  ```console
  $ ./git-timebraid ...                       an invocation whose output must contain the lines
                                              below it -- either its closing report, or the refusal
  spliced: libs/backend inside libs at ...    three of the examples demonstrate. Which of the two
  ```                                         it is, is settled by the text and needs no marker:
                                              a refusal cannot print a report, or the reverse.

  ```console
  $ git -C output log ...                     run in the example's directory; its output must match
  cf6b66a 2023-11-16 14:13:20 +0000 ...       the lines that follow, exactly, and it must write
  ```                                         nothing to stderr.

The info string is not read -- `bash` and `console` are there for rendering, and what settles which
rule applies is the `$`.

A line belongs to the command above it and nowhere else. There is no rule that reads a command-free
block, because a README also uses those for things that are not output at all -- the `<name>@<n>`
fixture notation, and example 02's hand-written summary of the two orderings.

Comparison allows for the four ways the READMEs are written, and nothing more:

  * an object id written with a trailing ellipsis -- the character U+2026, not three full stops --
    matches any id with those leading digits, so `655c6e6…` stands for the whole sha, while an id
    written out in full has to match in full, which is what keeps example 05's "these two trees are
    the same object" claim at full strength;
  * runs of whitespace collapse, since `ls-tree` output is padded by hand to line up;
  * an inline `# ...` annotation is stripped, which example 02 uses to date a commit inside the
    output it quotes;
  * a line reading `(no output)` stands for no output at all, which is how a command that prints
    nothing is quoted -- example 08's `grep` for what the scan left out rests on it. A command
    that failed prints nothing on stdout too, which is why a `$ git` line that writes anything to
    stderr fails whatever is quoted under it; the exit status could not tell the two apart, since
    a `grep` that finds nothing exits 1.

`./git-timebraid <args>` is executed as `java -jar <jar> <args>`, which is what the wrapper in the
repo root does. Pass the jar as the first argument; it defaults to target/lib/git-timebraid.jar,
which `mvn package` puts there beside the jars its manifest names.

Usage: check-examples.py [path/to/git-timebraid.jar]
Exit status is 0 when every example reproduces, 1 otherwise, with each failure printed.
