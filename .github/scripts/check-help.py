"""Keep the Options block in doc/usage.md equal to what `git-timebraid --help` prints.

A hand-written option list is a claim about the program that nothing checks, and it drifts the first
time an option is added, renamed or reworded. It still looks exactly like terminal output, so a
reader trusts it and copies a flag the program no longer accepts.

So the block is not written, it is taken. This script regenerates it with `--write` and, without,
fails when the file and the program disagree. The document marks where it goes with a BEGIN/END
pair, so what gets rewritten is stated by the document rather than inferred from its headings.

The output is stable to compare: the run below pins COLUMNS, so the layout does not depend on the
caller's window, and the width is the one the rest of doc/usage.md is written to rather than the
narrow fallback a redirected `--help` would otherwise take.

Usage:
  check-help.py            verify doc/usage.md matches the built jar
  check-help.py --write    rewrite the block from the built jar
