"""Hold the punctuation dash to one spelling, where the spelling is a choice and not a constraint.

Everything the program prints is ASCII, because a Windows console encodes to a code page that has
no em dash and substitutes a `?` for it. So a user-facing string writes ` -- `, and MessageCharsetTest
holds it there by reading the compiled constant pool.

Comments and prose reach no console, so that reason does not apply to them and the em dash is what
they use. Both spellings then live in one tree for different reasons, which is how they drift: a
pair of dashes around an aside gets its opening half from one file's habit and its closing half
from another's, and nothing notices.

**The unit is a comment, in whatever language the file is written in** -- not a file under src/main.
That is what keeps `readlink -- "$path"` out of it: an end-of-options marker is code, and code is
not read here. Each kind of file says where its comments are:

  * Kotlin -- a `//` anywhere on a line, and the body of a block comment;
  * shell and .properties -- a `#` line;
  * the Windows launcher -- a `@rem` or `rem` line, which is not the same marker as the shell's;
  * XML -- between `<!--` and `-->`;
  * Markdown -- the whole file is prose, minus fenced and indented blocks and HTML comments.

A backticked span is stripped wherever it appears, comment or prose, because a token in backticks
is quoted rather than written -- `-`/`--` names the argument, it does not punctuate the sentence.
The delimiter is a run of backticks of any length, so a ``--`` written in a doubled span is quoted
too.

Kotlin is scanned rather than searched, and the scanner is kotlin_source.py next door, because
three other checkers ask the same question of the same files: check-links.py reads what a comment
says, check-kdoc-links.py reads everything a comment is not, and check-doc-comments.py where each
comment lies. That module states why searching for the four openers one at a time cannot work.

src/test is read on the same terms as src/main. It holds no user-facing message, so nothing there
can be confused with one, and a comment in a test is read in the same editor as any other.
.github/scripts is left out because it writes ` -- ` throughout and is consistent in itself, and
pom.xml because Maven's own vocabulary carries the ASCII mark in contexts this cannot tell from
prose. The manual page is left out for the reason the messages are: groff reads the
bytes before it decides what a comment is, and refuses an em dash there with `invalid input
character code 128` -- so in roff the ASCII spelling is the only one, which makes it a constraint
rather than a choice, and there is nothing for this check to hold. The rest of what the scan below
does not read is named here too: doc/examples/build-inputs.sh, the workflows and .gitattributes, for
the first of those reasons, writing the ASCII mark and never the em dash; the root git-timebraid
wrapper and .editorconfig, which write neither; LICENSE and NOTICE, which are legal text; and
.gitignore and the plan.txt dumps, which are not prose at all.

**The pattern over-matches and is then filtered**, rather than enumerating the positions a dash can
sit in. A list of them -- between words, and at the end of a line -- misses three more: a line that
*begins* with the mark, a Markdown hard break ending ` --\\`, and a comment trailing a line of code.
Enumerating is how a detector is made to pass on the shape nobody thought of, which is the shape a
drift takes.
