# Renders each manual page in src/main/man as HTML under target/man-html, for the archives to carry.
#
# Git for Windows sets `help.format = html`, so `git timebraid --help` there asks for
# `git-timebraid.html` in `git --html-path` rather than for a manual page, and an archive carrying
# only the roff gives it nothing to open. The archives carry the HTML beside the roff, at
# share/doc/git-doc, the directory git's own pages sit in under its prefix; doc/install.md says where
# it has to be copied for git to find it.
#
# It is rendered here rather than in the Maven build, and committed nowhere: groff is a system tool
# Maven cannot fetch, so a `mvn package` that rendered the page would fail on every machine without
# it. The workflows run this before they package; a build that skips it packages no HTML, and
# smoke-distribution.sh refuses the archive.
#
# groff stamps a CreationDate into the output, which would make every render differ from the last.
# SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH is set to the date in the page's `.TH` line -- that of its last nontrivial
# change, per man-pages(7) -- so the same page renders to the same bytes on the same groff, and the
# stamp says something true. The groff version is in the output as well, in a Creator comment.
#
# The date becomes seconds through python3, which CI needs for its other checks anyway: `date`
# parses a date one way on Linux and another on macOS, and POSIX gives it no way at all. Written for
# the bash 3.2 macOS ships, since the macOS legs run it.
#
# Usage: render-man-html.sh
# Exit status is 0 when every page rendered without a word from groff on stderr, 1 otherwise.
