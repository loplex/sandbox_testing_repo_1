Two checkers need this: check-blocks.py measures the lines inside a code block, and
check-width.py measures the prose outside one. Each line of a document but a fence or a table row
has to fall to exactly one of them, so both ask the same function where the blocks are; two
scanners that disagreed about an indented block would leave its lines to neither.
