# This is the half `jlink` and the assembly plugin cannot check between them: that the thing a user
# downloads actually runs. The fixture is small but chosen for what it exercises --
#
#   * a commit message outside ASCII, which needs `jdk.charsets` in the bundled runtime (charsets
#     arrive through ServiceLoader, so jdeps never sees them and the module is on the list by hand);
#   * running `git` as a subprocess, which on Linux needs `lib/jspawnhelper` to have kept its
#     executable bit through the assembly. That is why the run is `--no-bare`: its checkout is a git
#     that has to start, where the calls JGit makes to git of its own accord only log a warning;
#   * the launcher's own JVM lookup and its jar-relative path resolution.
#
# Usage: smoke-distribution.sh [archive.tar.gz]
# With no argument it takes the platform archive out of target/ -- the one whose name carries an
# os-arch suffix, as opposed to the portable archive built beside it.
#
# Works on either archive. When the unpacked tree has a `runtime/`, JAVA_HOME is pointed at a path
# that does not exist, so reaching a JVM at all proves the launcher preferred the bundled one; the
# portable archive has no runtime and is run against whatever JVM is installed.
