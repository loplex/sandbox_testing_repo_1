"""Where the comments are in a Kotlin file, for the checkers that read them or read around them.

Four checkers need this, three ways: check-dashes.py and check-links.py read what a comment says,
check-kdoc-links.py reads everything a comment is not, and check-doc-comments.py asks only where
each comment lies, to find one standing on another. Every answer comes from one question -- where
does each comment start and end -- so they are answered in one place.

Kotlin is scanned rather than searched, because the four openers it reads -- a string, a raw
string, a `//` and a `/*` -- each hide the other three, and the one that comes first
wins. Searching for them one at a time is how a ` -- ` inside a user-facing message gets read as
the comment beside it, how a `//` inside a URL literal gets read as a comment and its path reported
as a broken pointer, and how a `/*` written inside a `//` comment turns the rest of the file into
one long comment.

A raw string's body is skipped like an ordinary string's: what triple quotes hold is data, not
prose. Read as code instead, a `//` in one would be reported as a comment and a `/*` in one would
open a block comment running to the end of the file -- the same confusions as above, reached
through the fourth opener rather than the first three.

An ordinary string ends at the newline if nothing closes it, because Kotlin has no line
continuation in one; a block comment or a raw string that nothing closes runs to the end of the
file, which is what the compiler does with it too.

It is not a Kotlin lexer, and two of the places where it falls short are worth knowing. A
character literal is not read as one, so `'"'` opens a string that hides the rest of its line.
And a block comment ends at its first `*/`, where Kotlin nests them: `/* a /* b */ c */` hands
` c */` back as code. check-comments.sh refuses a nested block comment anywhere under src/, which
is what keeps that one from mattering.
