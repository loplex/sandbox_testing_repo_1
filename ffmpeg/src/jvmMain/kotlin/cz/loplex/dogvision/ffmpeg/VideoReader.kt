/**
 * The frames of [file]'s first video stream, which ffprobe says is [stream], decoded by ffmpeg upright and at full
 * size, at the stream's average rate: a video of a varying rate has frames repeated or dropped, so that its sound stays
 * in step. A frame is 0xFFRRGGBB ints, a row after another, as core's images hold them.
 *
 * ffmpeg takes the colours by the matrix the video is tagged with; its default fast rounding shifted them by up to
 * 4 of 255 in ffmpeg 6.1, which accurate_rnd and full_chroma_int bring to 1, as in the writer's filter.
