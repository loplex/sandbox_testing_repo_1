# Cut the release commit onto a branch of its own: [Unreleased] closed into a section for the version being
# released; that version written back where the source declares one; one commit, on a branch named for the
# version. Everything a release does to the repository before anything is built, and nothing that needs a
# build. Nothing is pushed either: the build runs from this commit next, and a build that fails should leave
# neither a branch nor a draft behind - which is why pushing waits for the build to have succeeded, and goes
# with the draft.

# Driven by environment rather than by arguments, because that is how a composite action hands its inputs
# over - and kept out of action.yml so that it can be run against a repository in a test.
