/**
 * What a desktop window shows and does, in no toolkit, as the Python program's `LiveSession` holds it: the source, the
 * view, the language, what failed, and the pictures [renderer] draws; each window only lays it out, so that the Compose
 * window and the Swing one cannot drift apart.
 *
 * Its methods are called on the AWT event thread, and its flows change only there, through [post]: Compose Desktop
 * composes on that thread, and Swing collects on it. It starts on what [arguments] ask for, as the window does.
 *
 * The renderer is made by [makeRenderer] once, the feed of each source by [feed], ffmpeg downloaded by
 * [ffmpegDownloader] and installed through winget by [ffmpegInstaller], which [canInstallFfmpeg] says whether to offer
 * where it is missing, and [wingetFound] whether to offer winget as well; the tests give their own of each, and a
 * [post] that runs what it is given there and then.
