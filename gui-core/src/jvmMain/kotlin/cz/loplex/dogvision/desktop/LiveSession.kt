/**
 * What a desktop window shows and does, in no toolkit: the source, the cameras and their mirroring, the view, the
 * language, what failed, and the pictures [renderer] draws; each window only lays it out, so that the Compose window
 * and the Swing one cannot drift apart.
 *
 * Its methods are called on the AWT event thread, and its flows change only there, through [post]: Compose Desktop
 * composes on that thread, and Swing collects on it. It starts on what [arguments] ask for, as the window does.
 *
 * The renderer is made by [makeRenderer] once, the feed of each source by [feed], the cameras listed by [cameraLister]
 * through [inBackground], ffmpeg downloaded by [ffmpegDownloader] and installed through winget by [ffmpegInstaller],
 * which [canInstallFfmpeg] says whether to offer where it is missing, and [wingetFound] whether to offer winget as
 * well, the output folder, where none is named or chosen, by [defaultOutputDir], and whether ffmpeg, which a
 * recording needs, can be run by [ffmpegFound]; the tests give their own of each, and a [post] that runs what it is
 * given there and then.
