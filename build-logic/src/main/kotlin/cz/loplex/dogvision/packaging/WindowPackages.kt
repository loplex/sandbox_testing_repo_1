/**
 * Registers a window's deb and rpm, [packageName], on the system's Java, with the tasks they are made from, each named
 * after the package, as packageDogVisionSwingDeb and dogVisionSwingTree are dog-vision-swing's: [jars], the window's
 * JARs, in /usr/share/[packageName]/lib, the natives they load unpacked in /usr/lib/[packageName], where the FHS puts
 * what depends on the architecture, a launcher in /usr/bin, which finds a Java 17 or newer, and the desktop entry and
 * the icons, named [applicationId]. The command line is the package dog-vision-cli, which each recommends.
 *
 * - [sharedJars] are those of [jars] that the package [sharedPackage] installs, in /usr/share/[sharedPackage]/lib,
 *   which the packages depend on at their own version and leave out.
 * - [mainClass] is the class the launcher starts, its main the window's.
 * - [jvmOptions] are the launcher's options before org.lwjgl.librarypath's, given the folder of the natives.
 * - [nameSuffix] follows the desktop entry's name in each language.
 * - [summary] and [description] are what a package manager lists the packages with, in its search and its details.
 * - [nativesLeftIn] names the JARs, by the start of their names, whose natives are not unpacked.
 * - [rpmRequires] is what the rpm requires besides what every window's does.
