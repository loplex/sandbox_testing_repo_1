/**
 * Makes this task an uber JAR named [fileName], of [ownJar] and every JAR of [classpath], which `java -jar` runs alone,
 * starting [mainClass]. Each path held by more than one of them is checked rather than taken from whichever comes
 * first:
 *
 * - Left out of every JAR: its manifest, as this one writes its own; META-INF/INDEX.LIST, the JAR index, which JDK 18
 *   ignores and JDK 21 removed, and whose copy from LWJGL names JARs that are not beside this one; signatures, which
 *   the merged JAR breaks; module-info.class, as the JAR is no module; and [excludes].
 * - Left out of a JAR that holds no class: its .kotlin_module, which then lists no class of it. JetBrains' forwarding
 *   JARs, such as org.jetbrains.compose.runtime's runtime-desktop, hold one of the same name as the library they
 *   forward to, androidx.compose.runtime's.
 * - Any other path held twice has to be the same bytes each time, and is taken once; the task fails where it is not.
 *
 * [notices], what it holds that is not this project's own and under which licences, goes in as
 * META-INF/THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.txt, as [uberJarLicences] writes it.
