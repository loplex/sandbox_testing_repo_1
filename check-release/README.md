# check-release

`check-release` works from three things:

- the tags, read out of the repository it is asked about;
- `CHANGELOG.md`, read out of the same repository;
- the version a release is asked to be, taken from whichever source the invocation names.

The first two are the same everywhere; the third is what a project type decides.\
[Where the version comes from](#where-the-version-comes-from) says where the rules stop and the
source begins.

## Subcommands

`check-release.py` holds, as separate subcommands, what a release asks of a repository and does with
it:

| Subcommand        | What for                                                                                           |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `version`         | whether the [candidate version](#where-the-version-comes-from) may be released, given the releases |
| `next`            | the version that follows a released one, with the source's [marker](#where-the-version-comes-from) |
| `changelog`       | whether every released section of `CHANGELOG.md` still reads the way its tag has it                |
| `ancestry`        | whether every released tag is still reachable from this history                                    |
| `prefix`          | what release tags are called here                                                                  |
| `channel`         | the distribution channel a version goes to                                                         |
| `set-version`     | write a version where it is declared: the one released, then the next                              |
| `close-changelog` | move `[Unreleased]` into a section of its own, dated                                               |
| `notes`           | the text below one released section's heading, which is what its release notes say                 |

Of these, the composite action [below](#using-check-release-from-another-repository) runs:

- `version`, `changelog` and `ancestry`, whichever its `checks` input names;
- `channel`, after a `version` that says yes.

## Versions

A version here is a semantic version: `1.0.0`, `1.0.0-rc.1`, `1.0.0-eap-2`, `1.0.0+dfsg1`.\
The grammar is SemVer 2.0.0's own, so a leading zero and an empty identifier are refused rather than
ordered by rules nobody wrote down.

### Build metadata does not order releases

Build metadata - the `+` part, the shape Debian packaging reaches for - is taken, and the spec's
rule about it is taken with it:

> Build metadata MUST be ignored when determining version precedence. Thus two versions that differ
> only in the build metadata, have the same precedence.

That has one consequence worth meeting here rather than in a red run: `1.0.0+b` does not outrank
`1.0.0+a`, so releasing one after the other is refused - not because the `+` is unwelcome, but
because whoever compares versions would be offered no release at all.\
`version` says so in those words rather than as "does not come after", which about a version that
plainly came after would read as a bug.

A project needing `+dfsg1` to count as an upgrade needs an ordering SemVer does not define.\
`precedence()` in [`check-release/check-release.py`](check-release.py) is where that rule would go.

### The channel a version goes to

The channel a version goes to is the first identifier of its pre-release suffix, and `default` for a
final release.\
Identifiers are separated by dots, and a hyphen is an ordinary character inside one.\
Build metadata plays no part.

| Version       | Channel                 |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| `1.0.0`       | `default`               |
| `1.0.0-rc.1`  | `rc`                    |
| `1.0.0-eap-2` | `eap-2`, one of its own |
| `1.0.0-eap.2` | `eap`                   |

## The changelog

`CHANGELOG.md` is read in the shape [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) gives
it:

- a `## [Unreleased]` section on top;
- a `## [<version>]` section for each release below it.

A release closes `[Unreleased]` into a section of its own, so there has to be something under it.\
`close-changelog`, which `release-flow/prepare` runs, refuses an empty one, unless there are
pre-releases of the version to take in: a final release takes their entries into its own section.\
The `changelog` check reads only the released sections, not `[Unreleased]`.

## Using check-release from another repository

[`check-release/action.yml`](action.yml) is a composite action, so a project asks for the rules
rather than keeping a copy of them:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
  # release-flow/merge-back starts this workflow by hand, as its check-workflow, once a release has landed.
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  release-rules:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v7
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: loplex/release-ci/check-release@<tag>
        id: release
        with:
          source: gradle.properties
          checks: version changelog ancestry
```

### `branches` keeps the workflow off tags

Publishing a release creates its tag, and a workflow on `push` with no filter runs for that tag too,
where there is nothing to ask.\
The commit a release tags names the version it released.\
Where the source declares a version and no `version` input is handed in, `version` read off the
source there passes as that release, with a note saying so, rather than refusing it as released
already; a version handed in is still asked about.

### `checks` names `version`, which its default leaves out

`checks` names `version` here because its default, `changelog ancestry`, leaves it out.

- Every check named runs.
- The step fails at the end if any of them said no, naming each one that did.
- The [outputs](#outputs) are written all the same where `version` said yes.

### `<tag>` is a release tag

`<tag>` is one of this repository's release tags, as in every example here;
[Pinning](../README.md#pinning) says what other refs get.\
What the action needs of the runner is listed under
[What is here](../README.md#what-an-action-needs-of-the-runner).

### `tag-prefix` is left out where the source declares it

`tag-prefix` is left out above because `gradle.properties` declares the prefix, and a value given
here would answer over the top of it.\
Give it where the source declares none, as with `tags`.

Where such a source's tags carry no prefix at all, say `tag-prefix: ^none`:

- An empty value will not do: GitHub hands over an input left out and an input set to nothing as the
  same empty string.
- `^none` cannot be mistaken for a real prefix, because git refuses `^` in a ref name.

Why there is no default is under
[No default tag prefix, on purpose](#no-default-tag-prefix-on-purpose).

### `fetch-depth: 0` is not optional

A shallow checkout has neither the history `ancestry` reads nor the tags every check counts from.\
So the checks find nothing and pass having compared nothing, which is the one outcome worth fearing
here.\
Only `version` under `tags`, handed no version, fails instead: it finds no release to count from.

### Outputs

Where `version` is among the checks and says yes, the action answers with:

- `steps.<id>.outputs.version`, the version that may be released, bare under either source - `0.2.0`
  for a `0.2.0-SNAPSHOT` in `gradle.properties`;
- `steps.<id>.outputs.channel`, the channel that version goes to by the rule under
  [The channel a version goes to](#the-channel-a-version-goes-to): `default` for a final release,
  the first identifier of its pre-release suffix otherwise.

### The `version` input

The `version` input hands the `version` check a version of its own - a dispatch input, say:

- in place of the one the source declares;
- or, under `tags`, in place of the one after the highest release.

How one is spelled under each source is under
[Where the version comes from](#where-the-version-comes-from).

## Where the version comes from

Every invocation names its source, with `--source` or an action's `source` input, because the wrong
guess is silent.\
Two are implemented, and they differ in more than a filename:

| `--source`          | The version a release is asked to be                                              | After a release           |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `gradle.properties` | read from the file or handed in with `--version`, a `-SNAPSHOT` ending it dropped | the next one written back |
| `tags`              | handed in with `--version`, or the version after the highest release              | nothing to write          |

The version a release is asked to be, whichever way it is found, is the candidate version: what
`check-release version` holds to the rules.

### `-SNAPSHOT` belongs to `gradle.properties`

Carrying `-SNAPSHOT` belongs to `gradle.properties`: it is Gradle's and Maven's way of saying "not
released yet".

- A release takes it off the end of the version, whether the file declares it or `--version`, or the
  `version` input of `check-release` or `release-flow/prepare`, hands it in.
- A version handed in may also leave it out.
- A version that still carries it once a marker ending it, where the source has one, is off -
  `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-SNAPSHOT`, `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT+b`, or `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT` handed to `tags` - is refused
  whatever the source.
- A repository whose version lives only in its tags has no such state, so the version after a
  release is worked out bare and the source adds the marker where there is one.

### The first release under `tags`

Under `tags`, with nothing released yet, there is no highest release to follow.\
The first version is named with `--version`, or the `version` input of `check-release` or
`release-flow/prepare`.

### `set-version` under `tags` exits with 3

`set-version` under `tags` refuses rather than reporting a success in which nothing was written.\
It does so with exit status 3 rather than 1, so that a caller can tell "nothing to write to" from a
write that failed.

### The tag prefix

`--tag-prefix` says what release tags are called.

- Under `gradle.properties` the file says it where `--tag-prefix` is not given, in a `tagPrefix`
  line it then has to carry beside the `version` one.\
  `version = 0.2.0-SNAPSHOT` and `tagPrefix = v`, or `tagPrefix =` where the tags carry nothing in
  front, are the two lines it needs.
- A source naming no file, as `tags` does, has to be told, and `--tag-prefix ''` tells it the tags
  carry nothing in front.
- Every action taking `source` takes the prefix as its `tag-prefix` input, `^none` saying the tags
  carry none, as [above](#tag-prefix-is-left-out-where-the-source-declares-it).

#### No default tag prefix, on purpose

`--tag-prefix` has no default, on purpose.\
A repository tagging bare versions, read as though it tagged `v*`, turns up no releases at all.\
Every check over them - all but `version` under `tags` given no version, which finds no release to
count from - passes having compared nothing.\
A caller wanting a default declares it where its own readers can see it.

### Adding a source

Each source is an adapter in [`check-release/sources.py`](sources.py), and the rules know none of
them by name.

Adding `package.json`, `pyproject.toml` or `Cargo.toml` means one more adapter there:

- filed under the name `--source` gives it;
- its file carrying the tag prefix beside the version, as `gradle.properties` carries `tagPrefix`.

Nothing in the rules changes unless the new source marks a version being worked on other than with a
`-SNAPSHOT` suffix, the one marker they know.

A plain `VERSION` file has no room for a prefix, which the rules ask of every source naming a file
unless `--tag-prefix` is given, so it takes more than an adapter.

What an adapter has to answer, its file and the tag prefix included, is listed at the top of
[`sources.py`](sources.py).\
[`check-release/test_sources.py`](test_sources.py) holds every adapter to it, and asks one that
declares a version for a file to try it on.
