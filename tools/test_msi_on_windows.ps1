# Installs the MSI, upgrades it to a later one and removes it, checking each step: the windows'
# launchers with their shortcuts in the Start menu and on the desktop, the command line's with
# none but the installation folder on the system's PATH, and the web page with a shortcut in the
# Start menu to its index.html, without its script's source map, which is not installed by
# default. The MSI also removes the folder ffmpeg is downloaded into, %ProgramData%\<the app's
# name>, which the script makes before the upgrade, as a window would, and which has to stay over
# that.
#
# Then it installs one part alone, the Feature SwingGui, by ADDLOCAL naming it without its parent
# DogVision, which Windows Installer installs with it, into a folder of its own (INSTALLDIR); adds
# the Compose window, which is to go into that folder too; upgrades it, which is to keep both
# windows there and the command line and the web page out, as the MSI migrates the Features
# installed and takes the folder from the registry; and removes it.
#
# The MSIs are tools/package_msi_on_windows.ps1's or tools/package_msi_on_linux.sh's: -Msi of
# -Version, and -UpgradeMsi of the later -UpgradeVersion. Each check says whether it held, and every
# check runs, so that one failing does not hide the others; the script fails if any did. msiexec's
# logs go to -LogDir.
#
# It installs for every user and changes the machine, so it is for one that is thrown away after,
# such as a CI runner, run as an administrator in PowerShell 7 (pwsh). WIX names WiX Toolset 3,
