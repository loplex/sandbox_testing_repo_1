# and its jpackage makes the MSI through WiX Toolset 3, whose light.exe validates it (ICE) here.
# It is written to gui-compose/build/compose/binaries/main/msi/<version>.
#
# Needs:
# - PowerShell 7 (pwsh), which reads this file as UTF-8, as the vendor's name needs.
# - A JDK 25 as JAVA_HOME, as the Linux packages' runtime is.
# - WiX Toolset 3.14's candle.exe and light.exe on the PATH, or its installation's WIX variable.
#
# -AppVersion gives the MSI another version than gui-compose/build.gradle.kts's packageVersion, as a
# test of an upgrade needs a later one; the application in it stays the same.
