# Builds the MSI for Windows on x86-64 on Windows, into tools\build\msi, which git ignores, as
# tools\build\msi\dog-vision-0.1.0.msi: the same MSI as tools/package_msi_on_linux.sh builds through
# Wine, but with the jpackage of the JDK this runs on, and with light.exe's validation (ICE), which
# fails under Wine.
#
# jpackage makes the app image, into tools\build\app-image\dog-vision, of the arguments that
# :packaging's windowsJpackage task writes: the Compose window's dog-vision.exe, the Swing
# window's dog-vision-swing.exe and the command line's dog-vision-cli.exe, with their JARs and the
# runtime that its windowsRuntime task links. jpackage puts every JAR on each launcher's classpath,
# so this then copies the launchers' .cfg that the windowsLauncherConfigs task writes, each with its
# own JAR alone. WiX Toolset 3's candle.exe and light.exe make the MSI of what the windowsWix task
# writes of the image: packaging\windows\dog-vision.wxs, which says what the MSI does, and the
# image's files.
#
# Needs:
# - PowerShell 7 (pwsh), which reads this file as UTF-8.
# - A JDK 25 as JAVA_HOME, for its jpackage.
# - WiX Toolset 3.14's candle.exe and light.exe on the PATH, or its installation's WIX variable.
#
# -AppVersion gives the MSI another version than gradle.properties' appVersion, as a test of an
# upgrade needs a later one; the application in it stays the same.
