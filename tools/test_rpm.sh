# Installs an rpm of the project's, dog-vision, dog-vision-swing, dog-vision-cli, dog-vision-web or
# dog-vision-web-sourcemap, in a bare container, runs it and removes it, checking each step. With
# --upgrade, it installs a later rpm over the first before removing it, as an update does. With
# --temurin, it installs Adoptium's Temurin JRE first, from Adoptium's repository, and checks that
# the rpm takes it rather than an OpenJDK.
#
# A bare image has no desktop, and openSUSE's has no /etc/xdg/menus, which is what a headless
# install for the command line alone meets. dnf or zypper installs the rpm there with its
# dependencies, a Java among them, and microdnf those its repositories have; rpm removes it.
# dog-vision's window is then opened under Xvfb, installed only once the rpm's own dependencies
# are, as tools/test_deb.sh does, and of dog-vision-web the desktop entry and the file it opens, as
# tools/test_deb.sh says. Each check says whether it held, and every check runs, so that one
# failing does not hide the others; the script fails if any did.
#
# An rpm of the project's that the rpm requires at its own version is installed with it from the
# rpm's own folder, as tools/test_deb.sh says.
#
# Both convert test_photo.jpg, beside this script, as tools/test_deb.sh says.
#
# A later rpm is the same build with another version, `-PappVersion=0.1.1`, which
# `:packaging:packageRpm` writes beside the first.
