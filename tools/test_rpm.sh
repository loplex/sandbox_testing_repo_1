# Installs an rpm of the project's, dog-vision, dog-vision-swing or dog-vision-cli, in a bare
# container, runs it and removes it, checking each step. With --upgrade, it installs a later rpm
# over the first before removing it, as an update does. With --temurin, it installs Adoptium's
# Temurin JRE first, from Adoptium's repository, and checks that the rpm takes it rather than an
# OpenJDK.
#
# A bare image has no desktop, and openSUSE's has no /etc/xdg/menus, which is what a headless
# install for the command line alone meets. dnf or zypper installs the rpm there with its
# dependencies, a Java among them, and microdnf those its repositories have; rpm removes it.
# dog-vision's window is then opened under Xvfb, installed only once the rpm's own dependencies
# are, as tools/test_deb.sh does. Each check says whether it held, and every check runs, so that
# one failing does not hide the others; the script fails if any did.
#
# Both convert test_photo.jpg, beside this script, as tools/test_deb.sh says.
#
# A later rpm is the same build with another version, `-PappVersion=0.1.1`, which
# `:desktop:packageRpm`, `:swing:packageRpm` and `:cli:packageRpm` write beside the first.
#
# Needs docker, or podman installed as docker. Usage:
#   tools/test_rpm.sh [--temurin] [--upgrade <a later rpm>] <the rpm> [image with dnf, zypper or
#   microdnf, fedora:42 by default]
