#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Builds the app images for Windows on x86-64 on Linux, through Wine: each a folder with its
# launchers, their JARs and a runtime of its own, which runs under Wine as it is, without being
# installed. Without --image both, one after the other; with --image dog-vision the one the MSI
# installs, with the Compose window's dog-vision.exe, the Swing window's dog-vision-swing.exe and
# the command line's dog-vision-cli.exe, which runs in a console; with --image dog-vision-cli the
# command line's, with dog-vision-cli.exe alone.
#
# Each is written to tools/build/app-image, as tools/build/app-image/dog-vision, and its folder
# printed; tools/build holds what the scripts in tools build, which git ignores.
# tools/package_msi_on_linux.sh makes the MSI of the one, and tools/package_cli_zip_on_linux.sh the
# command line's zip of the other.
#
# jpackage makes an app image for Windows only on Windows, so this runs a Windows JDK 17's
# jpackage.exe under Wine, in the locale cs_CZ.UTF-8, with the arguments that :packaging's
# windowsJpackage task writes, or its windowsCliJpackage, which tools/package_msi_on_windows.ps1 and
# tools/package_cli_zip_on_windows.ps1 hand jpackage on Windows as well: what the package is, and
# what the image runs, its launchers' JARs and the runtime that the image's windowsRuntime or
# windowsCliRuntime task links. jpackage puts every JAR on each launcher's classpath, so this then
# copies the launchers' .cfg that the image's windowsLauncherConfigs or windowsCliLauncherConfigs
# task writes, each with its own classpath. An app image needs neither WiX nor .NET.
#
# The JDK is a 17, as Wine 11.18's TransmitFile, handed a file where Windows expects a socket, fails
# with another error than Windows's WSAENOTSOCK, which the JDK from 18 on takes for a failed copy
# ("transfer failed"), and JDK 17's jpackage copies files without it. The runtime is no JDK 17's:
# windowsRuntime or windowsCliRuntime links it from Temurin's jmods for Windows of the release
# in gradle/libs.versions.toml.
#
# Needs:
# - Wine. Its prefix is WINEPREFIX's, or without it mono_msi_builder among winetricks' named
#   prefixes where that is there, which tools/make_wine_prefix_on_linux.sh makes for the MSIs, and
#   else Wine's own.
# - The locale cs_CZ.UTF-8.
# - --jdk: a Windows JDK 17, unpacked, for its bin/jpackage.exe; without it, the one that
#   tools/fetch_msi_tools_on_linux.sh downloads into tools/cache, or into the directory --tools
#   names.
#
# --app-version gives the launchers another version than gradle.properties' appVersion, as an
# MSI's test of an upgrade needs a later one; the application in it stays the same.
#
# Run it from anywhere.
