        "How much the RNL colour saturation changes saturation compared with the fixed one. Below 1 the"
        " species tells colours apart worse than we do, above 1 better."
        "\n\nIt comes from the receptor noise limited model of Vorobyev & Osorio (1998), which counts"
        " just-noticeable differences from each cone's noise, set by the share of cones of its kind. The"
        " output is rescaled until a human looking at it counts as many differences as the animal would."
