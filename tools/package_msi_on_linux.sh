# Builds the desktop window's MSI for Windows on x86-64 on Linux, through Wine.
#
# jpackage makes an installer only on the system the installer is for, so this runs a Windows JDK's
# jpackage.exe under Wine, over the JAR that `:gui-compose:windowsUberJar` assembles, with WiX Toolset 3
# making the MSI. As the Linux packages have, it has a runtime of its own, the window's launcher
# dog-vision.exe, and dog-vision-cli.exe, the command line alone, which runs in a console. It is
# written to gui-compose/build/compose/binaries/main/msi.
#
# Three steps go round Wine 11.18, where they fail:
# - Wine's TransmitFile, handed a file where Windows expects a socket, fails with another error than
#   Windows's WSAENOTSOCK, which the JDK from 18 on takes for a failed copy ("transfer failed"). So
#   jpackage.exe comes from a JDK 17, which copies files without it, and the runtime, a JDK 25 as on
#   Linux, is linked by this machine's jlink from the Windows JDK's jmods.
# - light.exe's validation of the MSI (ICE) fails in Wine's msi.dll with 0x65B, so light.exe runs a
#   second time without it (-sval), as electron-builder runs it off Windows; jpackage has no way to
#   pass the switch. .github/workflows/msi-under-wine.yml validates the MSI on Windows instead.
# - WiX 3 finds its own version through .NET's FileVersionInfo, which Wine Mono leaves empty, and
#   jpackage then does not recognise it: the prefix needs Microsoft's .NET Framework 4.8
#   (`winetricks dotnet48`).
#
# Needs:
# - Wine, with .NET Framework 4.8 in the prefix; WINEPREFIX chooses the prefix, as it does for Wine.
# - The locale cs_CZ.UTF-8, which Wine runs in: JDK 17's jpackage reads its arguments in Windows's
#   ANSI code page, which Wine takes from the locale, and the vendor's ř is in Windows-1250, a Czech
#   locale's, not in Windows-1252, an English locale's or C's, where it becomes "?" and jpackage
#   fails on it.
# - --jdk: a Windows JDK 17, unpacked, for its bin/jpackage.exe.
# - --jmods: the Windows JDK's jmods, unpacked, of the same version as this machine's jlink (Temurin
#   ships them apart from the JDK, as OpenJDK25U-jmods_x64_windows_*.zip).
# - --wix: WiX Toolset 3.14's binaries, unpacked, the directory holding candle.exe and light.exe
#   (wix314-binaries.zip from github.com/wixtoolset/wix3). WiX 3 and 5 are free under the MS-RL;
#   from WiX 6 on, the binaries come under the Open Source Maintenance Fee's EULA, and JDK 17's
#   jpackage takes WiX 3 alone.
#
# Run it from anywhere.
