"""Write what the desktop dog-vision computes, as the reference core's tests compare against.

The desktop dog-vision is https://github.com/loplex/dog-vision. From a checkout of it, run

    uv run --project <checkout> python tools/reference_values.py core/src/test/resources

It writes three files there, each line tab-separated:

- reference.tsv: a kind of value, the species and the chroma scale it is for, and the values.
- images.tsv: a case of the image pipeline, the width and height of its result, and the result's
  pixels, row by row, each as R, G and B. The input is pattern(), which the tests draw alike.
- facts.tsv: a species, the English label of one of its facts, and the pieces of its value.
