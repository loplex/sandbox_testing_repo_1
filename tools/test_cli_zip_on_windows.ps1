# Tries the command line's zip for Windows on a Windows machine: it unpacks the zip into a folder
# whose name has a space, checks that it holds the launcher, LICENSE, THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.txt and
# the runtime's legal folder, puts it on the PATH, and from another folder runs dog-vision-cli with
# --help, on a photo, which it converts, and with an option it does not know, which exits with 2.
#
# -Zip is the zip, as tools/package_cli_zip_on_windows.ps1 or tools/package_cli_zip_on_linux.sh
