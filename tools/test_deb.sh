# Installs a deb of the project's, dog-vision-compose, dog-vision-swing, dog-vision-cli,
# dog-vision-common, dog-vision-web, dog-vision-web-sourcemap or dog-vision, which holds the first
# five, in a bare container, runs it and removes it, checking each step. With --upgrade, it installs
# a later deb over the first before removing it, as an update does. With --temurin, it installs
# Adoptium's Temurin JRE first, from Adoptium's repository, and checks that the deb takes it rather
# than an OpenJDK.
#
# With --switch, it then installs another deb: in the first one's place where it conflicts with it,
# as dog-vision and each package it holds do with one another, and beside it otherwise. It checks
# that apt removed every package the other deb conflicts with, and that of the first deb's files
# only those an installed package owns are left, then goes on with the other deb as the package,
# which it removes in the end, after the first deb where that stays installed, checking what each
# leaves behind.
#
# A bare image has no desktop and none of its folders, /usr/share/applications among them, which is
# what a headless install for the command line alone meets. apt installs the deb there with its
# dependencies, a Java among them. Each window is then opened under Xvfb, which is installed only
# once the deb's own dependencies are, so that its X libraries hide none the deb misses. No browser
# runs there, so of dog-vision-web it checks the desktop entry, with desktop-file-validate, and that
# the file it opens with xdg-open is there. Each check says whether it held, and every check runs,
# so that one failing does not hide the others; the script fails if any did.
#
# A deb of the project's that the deb depends on at its own version, as dog-vision-web-sourcemap
# does on dog-vision-web and the command line and both windows on dog-vision-common, which no
# repository has, is installed with it from the deb's own folder, and so is the later one's from
# the later deb's.
#
# The command line converts test_photo.jpg, beside this script, and both windows show it.
# ffmpeg made it:
#   ffmpeg -f lavfi -i testsrc2=size=160x120:rate=1 -frames:v 1 -q:v 4 test_photo.jpg
#
# A later deb is the same build with another version, `-PappVersion=0.1.1`, which
# `:packaging:packageDeb` writes beside the first.
