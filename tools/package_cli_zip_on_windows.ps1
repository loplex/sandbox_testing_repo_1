# Builds the command line's zip for Windows on x86-64 on Windows: dog-vision-cli, to unpack and run
# anywhere without installing it.
#
# jpackage makes its app image with dog-vision-cli.exe, a native launcher that runs in a console,
# of the arguments that :packaging's windowsCliJpackage task writes, with the JARs that cli's
# windowsLauncher task writes and the runtime that :packaging's windowsCliRuntime task links from
# Temurin's jmods for Windows, and this then copies the launcher's .cfg that :packaging's
# windowsCliLauncherConfigs task writes, with the classpath in its order; the zip holds that image
# and the licence. It is written to tools\build\zip, which git ignores.
# tools/package_cli_zip_on_linux.sh builds the same zip through Wine.
#
# Needs:
# - PowerShell 7 (pwsh), which reads this file as UTF-8.
# - A JDK 25 as JAVA_HOME, whose jpackage makes the app image.
